!ReadMe for Zap.Code directory:

!ReadMe    - This file.

ObeySpt    - Module "ObeySupport" providing:
             *IfInTW     - are we in a taskwindow?
             *IfRunning  - is this task running?
             *IfVarSet   - is this variable set?
             *IfWrite    - is this directory writable? (ignores lock flag)

IfThere	   - Used on start up to help set up paths to !ZapFonts and !ZapUser.

Zap	   - The main Zap executable.  If you've run !Zap previously then
	     running this can be used as a quick and very dirty way of
	     starting Zap.

ZapRunFile - Utility used when the user clicks on a file which is set to
	     load into Zap.  It performs the same function as the command:

	     Run ZapCode:IfInTW Then Type %%*0 -TabExpand ELSE
	     IF "<Zap$Running>"="Yes" THEN Zap_Desktop %%*0 ELSE
	     Run <Zap$Dir>.!Run %%*0

	     It does not use up so much space on the command line, enabling
	     Zap to load files deep within RISC OS directory structures
	     which it would otherwise be unable to reach due to the 255
	     character limit imposed by OSCLI.

SetZapGen  - Finds an appropriate place to put Zap's on-the-fly files.
	     Typically this will be ZapUser:Generated.

Config     - A directory containing ConfigScan, CreateConf and !ZapConfig.
	     The first two of these programs perform the configuration
	     checking that forms the main part of Zap's new plug and play
	     module installation system.

Extensions - Various command scripts which load modular extensions to Zap.

Filters    - A directory for filters for use with ZapText's FILTER* and
             *PIPE* commands.

Tools      - A directory containing some tools for working with Zap.
