This is a new version of the IClear module, designed to work with 26 or
32-bit processors. Copyright of this software remains with the author but it
may be freely copied and distributed, including distribution by magazine
discs, PD libraries, email, bulletin boards etc., provided the following
conditions are adhered to:

1. No charge is made other than to cover the reasonable cost of duplication
and distribution.

2. No alteration is made to either the software or this text file.

3. This text file accompanies all copies of the software.

4. The software may be copied and distributed with or without the source
code as issued by the author. The source code, if included, is subject to
further conditions which are described in an accompanying text file.

Please note that this module will only work with RISC OS 3 or later.

IClear is a module which makes it easier to delete text from a writable
icon. Under RISC OS, to replace the text in such an icon with new text, you
first have to either delete all the characters of the old text or press
Ctrl-U to clear it. This can be a nuisance, especially if you have just
selected the icon with the mouse, as you first have to transfer to the
keyboard, then press Ctrl-U before you can type in your new text.

With IClear running, simply double-click on the writable icon, using either
Select or Adjust. The icon will be inverted, which usually means that it
will turn black with white text. As soon as you press a key, the text in the
icon will vanish, to be replaced with the character that you typed. If you
change your mind after inverting the icon and decide you want to keep your
existing text, a further click with any mouse button anywhere on the screen
will de-invert the icon and put things back to normal.

This software will work with writable icons (button type 15) and also
draggable writable icons (button type 14) but not with writable menu items.

An additional feature has been added called ArrowDrag. By holding down
Select or Adjust and pressing one of the arrow keys, the mouse pointer may
be moved by a single pixel in any direction, making precision drags easier.
Diagonal drags are possible by holding down two arrow keys. This feature is
based on a little-known feature of Draw, making it global, and works with
the dedicated arrow keys and the keypad arrow keys.

Programming Notes are contained in the text file accompanying the source
code.
