  ZapCVS provides syntax colouring and editing utilities in Zap for CVS log
files - it is intended to be used for editing these messages when committing
to the repository.
  
Lines beginning with CVS: are coloured differently, and the FORMATTEXT 
command and word-wrap options won't touch them.

  To install it, copy the !ZapCVS application inside the !Zap.Modules 
directory, then restart Zap.


For anyone interested, here is the changelog:
