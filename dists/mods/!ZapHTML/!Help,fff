ZapHTML v0.02Beta
=================

Disclaimer
---------
These are mainly installation notes.  It is not a manual.
This module was developed on Zap v.130.  I can hardly vouch for it working
on this version of Zap let alone any others.  Further more it was developed
on a RISC PC 700 and an A3000 (ROS3.11).  I can't see there being any machine
compatibility problems but then most people don't :-)

Your copy of Zap should now support HTML documents.  Just drag them in,
<shift> double click on them or create them as you would any other document.

Most of the commands will insert an empty pair of tags, however if you have
some selected text it will be surrounded by the tags.

Don't forget.  You are Beta testers - I want bug reports and ideas for
improvements.  I include the source for your edification and interest.

The current version - 0.03Beta
------------------------------

The Easter holidays are here and some real work has been done.  Thanks to all
the advice and suggestions I started rewriting great chunks of the code.

Gone now are the commands for each HTML tag, replaced by three generalised
commands: pairs, single tags and lists.  Thanks to Frederic Elisei for
pointing out how much needless work I was doing there.

Big improvements have been made to the keyboard handling code.  Now all
entities supported by HTML2 have been included.  Thanks to Andy Waddington
for the code to do this.  After having a look at his code I decided that this
program would probably be much better off with him in charge, but he's not
getting it :-)  There have been some changes to the key map so watch out
for that.

Lot's of work has been done on the insertion code to tidy it up.  It used to
insert tags around any selected text regardless of which file it was in.  That
has now been corrected.  Selected text is now only used if it is in the html
file in question.  Also editing using the split cursor should work now.

Some small tweaks have been made too.  Now files that are loaded from a
directory called 'html' will be assumed to be HTML files and my mode will be
invoked.  <tab> can now be used to complete filenames when asked to enter
URL's.

Ideas List
----------

For bang up to date information on how things are progressing and bug reports
why not try the ZapHTML home page on
http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~ceemah/MyPages/ZapHTML.html

Short term
----------
OK, for version 0.04Beta I intend to:

* Modify the template command to include the HTML compliance remark line.
* Include Andrew Wards code for pathname conversion and graphic size
  inclusion.
* Have a look at the dodgy working of the text colouring code.
* Include support for both ARCWeb and the Ant Internet suite


Long term
---------
Here are my long term aims:

* All commands available from a menu.  This has been implemented but it
  doesn't work at the moment so I have commented it out.
* Show the key shortcuts in the menus.
* Support for forms.
* Support for HTML3
