               ZapAda, a Zap syntax colouring mode
               ===================================

1.0 Features
============

This module performs syntax colouring designed for Ada documents.

It has bracket matching modelled after the old style C mode.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no cliam that it is bug-free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all it is
redistributed intact.  If engaging in large-scale distribution, it is
requested that you contact the author before doing so to obtain his
permission to do this.  This is mainly to allow him to supply the latest
version.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the application !ZapAda into Zap's Modules directory and reboot Zap.


3.0 Problems
============

colouring problems.

'#'-form of alternative base numbers not properly supported.
