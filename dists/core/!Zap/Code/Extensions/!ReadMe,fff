			Zap extensions
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory is intended to contain extensions to Zap which do not have a
natural home in the 'Modules' directory.

The distribution copy of Zap should contain the following directories here:

ExtAsm     - Darren's extensions to the Debugger and BASIC modules providing
	     extensions to their assembly capabilities.  These should
	     logically be placed in System:Modules, but are included here
	     anyway for convenience of distribution.
FlashCar   - Reuben Thomas and Tim Tyler's caret flasher
HidePtr    - Martin's HidePtr module.
IClear     - A patch whcih selects writable icons on clicks.
KeyExtend  - Darren's KeyboardExtend system which tries to make Zap's keys
             processing more reliable.
LineEditor - Olly's line editor.

Zap boots these using the Obey files in the directory root:

The Debugger is loaded on entry to Code mode.

HidePtr is loaded when Zap starts up.

KeyboardExtend is loaded when Zap starts up.

The LineEditor is loaded when it is needed to provide a history in the
search and replace window, the minibuffer or in TaskWindows.

ZapRedraw is loaded when Zap is loaded, or when required if the
Autoload.Zap Redraw option is ticked.

The current version of ZapBASIC supports these extensions, trying to load the
LineEditor on entry to TaskWindows, the Debugger when it needs to and
the assembler if it has failed to assemble an assembler instruction
(assuming these options are turned on).  

Note that the assembler will always be killed, if it has been loaded by Zap,
when it has finished using its facilities - Zap will never load this module
and leave it active on your system.

The other modules are /not/ killed when Zap quits - they may have other
clients.
