I'm aware that more commands have surfaced since I wrote this. The ones I
know about are:
  COMMANDIB (TMT)
  SENDURLSTRING (DS)

SendURLString is all part of the grand URL launcher system that Darren
maintains. That can jolly well stay where he's the only person who has to
worry about it :-)

CommandIB could probably go into the core. Having said that, ZapTMT still
contains some commands which aren't duplicated in some way somewhere else, so
it could stay sitting there.
There is possibly the need for a similar command, which simulates running a
command with the cursor position taken from a window's stored cursor
position. (This would allow INSERT, etc., to be used from a menu and to work
on the window you'd expect, rather than the one with the cursor in.)

Notes
-----

[1]	DWExt programming things.
Stuff like CC, MAKE et al. These could either go into the programming
extension or be left in their own module. DS prefers the latter (which makes
more sense, providing that MAKE, CC etc. aren't obsoleted by MJE's rewrite of
his similar routines).

Further: Textual Mode Description Files (TMFs) will be implemented by myself
once v1.40 is out. These will allow per-mode configurability of how MAKE,
BUILD, CC etc. work, and these should therefore end up replacing the gamut of
commands we have at the moment. They will end up in ZapProg.

[2]	Core.
Tim doesn't like putting commands into the core when they can comfortably go
elsewhere. I've moved all the ones out of here that I can - the remaining
ones should either go into the core, or remain where they are, IMO. Whatever,
nothing is going to happen here until post v1.40 now.

[3]	ToIcon.
Suggestions as to what to do with this are welcome. It could go into a
utilities extension, I suppose.

Alternatively (and this is an idea I much prefer), we could bin the command
completely and use global clipboard for this. There are a number of apps out
there which do this, although not reliably. Tim has suggested that ToIcon
might still be useful even then - it will probably stay in ZapDS along with
the other commands that Darren maintains there.

[4]	ModBrk (sets a breakpoint in a module)

I'm not sure about this ... it seems awfully "hacky". So it can probably
stay where it is (DWExt), at least until all the other bits of DWExt get
nuked.

[5]	REVERT

This was going to go into ZapUtil. Unfortunately the way I think it *should*
work, namely to preserve window positions, means that it has to be more
tightly bound to Zap than is possible in an extension; it's looking likely
that a rewrite of this command will end up in the core at some point.
