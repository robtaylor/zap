Warning:
--------

 If you are going to use this with UnixFS, see the Problems heading below!!!!
 

Description:
------------

 ZapMan is a Zap mode for reading Unix style 'man' pages. This mode is still
in major development, so there are bound to be bugs. Please let me know if
you find one that's not listed below.

 The mode now has a menu, which just executes the commands in brackets. See
below for descriptions of what they do.
 
 Search...               (Man_Search)
 Selection -> Regular    (Man_Regular)
	      Bold       (Man_Bold)
	      Underline  (Man_Underline)

 For an example, take a look at !ZapMan.manpage in both text and man modes.


Installation: (You need at least !Zap 1.36 to use this mode)
-------------

 Simply drag the !ZapMan directory into the !Zap.Modules directory and add the
following two lines near the top of your ClickSend file:

| This causes a manpage to be looked up (ZapMan)
&600	.	\[A-Za-z0-9_().]\%	Man_Search	=Man

You don't have to add this, but it's very useful! Just Alt+Double click on a
command name referenced in the man page, and it will be looked up.


Commands:
---------

 As well as giving you a Man mode, this module supplies 4 commands.
These are:

 * Man_Search <string>
 
   This command can be used to find a man page. You can supply an optional
   section if you wish.
   
   Eg: Man_Search "Mail(1)" - find Mail in section 1
       Man_Search "biff"    - find biff in any section
   
   The path searched is "Man:" (<Man$Path>), modify it in the !ZapMan.!Setup
   file. The supplied one is for UnixFS.
   
 
 * Man_Regular

   This will convert the selected region to regular text, removing all bold
   and underline.
   
 
 * Man_Bold
 
   This will convert any regular text in the selected region to bold text.
   
 
 * Man_Underline
 
   This will convert any regular text in the selected region to underlined
   text.
   
 
Problems:
---------

 Due to the fact that man pages are designed to be viewed at a width of 80
characters, you cannot change the window width from 80, as this would only
mess up the display. This is also due to a bit of a hack at the moment. I'm
working on it... Also due to this, you can keep typing off the end of a line,
and you won't be able to see what's happenning. Currently, you'll just have
to hit return, or have word-wrap turned on, to get around this.

 Due to what seems to be a problem in UnixFS (at least in v0.12), if you look
up a few man pages, or have a longish Man$Path specification, and the page
you want is near the end, the machine may hang, and need a reboot. As far as
I can tell, this is purely a UnixFS problem, since opening a few files in
basic seems to hang the machine too. So, save any important work before you
look up a page!

 You have been warned!


Thanks:
-------

 Thanks to all on zap-devel for their bug reports, interest and ideas, and
especially Tim Tyler for his suggestions.


To do: (probably in this order)
------

 * Allow user to change bold & underline styles as well as colours.
 
 * Fix the major hack of logical/physical line handling.
 
 * Fix TAB handling.
