               ZapSQL, a Zap syntax colouring mode
               ====================================

1.0 Features
============

This module performs syntax colouring designed for SQL documents.

As a result (in part) of the large syntax of SQL, this is not the fastest
Zap mode ever written.

It contains old C mode style bracket matching.

Note that the settings for the delay (in centiseconds) may range
over the even numbers only from zero to 62.

Setting this to zero turns the option off.
This may default to off, and may need to be configured via the mode menu
before it will do anything.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no claim that it is bug-free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all it is
redistributed intact.  If engaging in large-scale distribution, please
contact the author to get the latest version.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !ZapSQL application into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 Problems
============

                              Mode problems:
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The bracket matching gets confused by brackets embedded in strings.

                       Syntax colouring problems:
 		       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Only the "Reserved keywords" have been included.  The "Non-reserved
  keywords" and "Future keywords" may be easily added.
  
* The keywords are all coloured the same colour.  This could be easily
  changed.
  
* BNF syntax appears to be incompletely handled - I have not yet
  had any advice about how to cope with this.

* Syntax colouring does not have specific colours for brackets - yet.

* From its context, "BINDING" would appear to be an undocumented keyword?
