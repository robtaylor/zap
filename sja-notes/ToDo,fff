Beyond v1.40
============

(Old ToDo list follows at end of file.)

Bugs:
-----
	- with a long (> width) last line, selecting by dragging a selection downwards:
		a) after a triple-click, doesn't select any of the last logical line
		b) dragging down 'off' the LHS doesn't select any of the last physical line
	  (Tim)
	- BASIC colours 'lr' in lr% as a register in assembler (Reuben)
	- (more a misfeature) throwback moves oldest view on a file, not
	  most recent / one that search was started in (Theo)
	- crash on shift-end? (Chris Bell)
	- RAM transfer from Zap to Impression? "Directory [rubbish] not found" (Chris Bell)
	- sort out problem associated with ZapGenerated: on a read-only file
	  system (ie: make sure it never is!). Solution (?): use <Wimp$ScrapDir>.Zap. for
	  ZapGenerated$Path . (Chris Bell)
	- BASIC mode: undo falls over sometimes
	- BASIC mode: cursor disappears sometimes?
	- DWExt: incorrectly still refers to !Zap.3rdParty somewhere?
	- double/triple/etc-click dragging - moving backwards selects from
	  start of word/line/etc., not end. Can this easily be altered?
	  Also: new word/line/etc. should be selected as soon as mouse hits start of
	  unit, not end.

Documentation:
--------------

Core:
-----

	- configurable print headers and footers
	- redefine keystrokes in dialogue boxes (idea from StrongED - probably don't bother)
	- keypresses on a hotkey window
	- shortcuts (ie: expanding abbreviations) - only don't put it in the core
	- longer search macros
	- typing replaces selection?
	- indent/outdent performable on a single line
	- some way of including menu help text in the menu definitions
	- some sort of link to the manual from iconbar menu / Info window
	- stopop if necessary on mouse click in window (Cursors:mouse_click
	  before e_click call? - after FNSTR R11,key_lastcom)
	- alt+shift over selection -> selection menu?
	  switch to invert behaviour (no modifiers -> selection menu)?
	  *** if so, re-arrange reserved menu space: 0-9 'special', 10-19
	  'internal mode', 20+ unreserved ***
	  Use Cursors:testifinsideselection
	- &3xx command sequence to execute on startup
	- &3xx variable to specify default mode
	- throwback sets file title to something useful (internal, plus
	  Message_ThrowbackStart -> Message_TaskNameRq)
	- 'tie' two windows together? (or more windows ...)
	- NewFile: fix cursor positioning bug
	- Revert
	- bit fields use symbols not constants (merely source tidying)
	- support for modes to multiply instantiate (see ZapSEd) - mode cloning
	- TMFs (and set per-file temporarily; setvar command)
	- commands in file header
	- mode info block (replace e_interrogate #14)
	- folding
	- narrowing

	- MessageTrans-ify (internationalisation) - DS work in progress

Extensions:
-----------

ZapText	- SwapCase is nice to tokenised modes
ZapUtil	- setname uses TMFs
ZapProg	- new MAKE/CC etc. commands using TMFs
	- header/function/TLD finding (liaise with Tim, check out DWExt)
	- AssembleADRL/X
	- DataAdd et al
	- SWIToName, SWIToNumber
ZapSEd	- parsing StrongED mode files (plus extensions?) - see core
ZapSGML	- colours based on supplied DTD

Other things:
-------------

RCS/CVS for Risc OS, and support within Zap

Probably drop:
--------------

Larch, ZapTerm (=> ssh for Risc OS), ZapW3
Other IDE functions / external tie-in IDE (source browser / makefile management)?

















Things to do
============

									Notes
Core:
-----
e_returnword
	- DELETE "WORD", DELWORDSTART|END	Day ?			Necessary?	?
	  (delete whitespace around also)			-- not binary modes
source
	- All bit field things should use symbols not constants
Newfile
	- Fix cursor positioning bug?
Revert
	- Tie down details?

ZapBASIC:
---------
	- basic_returnword						TMT
	- basic_help							TMT

Command extensions:
-------------------

ZapText
	- SwapCase is nice to BASIC					TMT
ZapProgram
	- New MAKE/CC/etc. commands
	- ??? header/function/TLD finding
	- AssembleADRL/X
	- DataAdd
	- SWIToName, SWIToNumber

v1.50 alterations:
------------------
TMFs
	- setname: param, or if "" search for in-core.
	  This should be configurable by a variable, using
	  InCoreName-Start and InCoreName-End or similar.
	  Also InCoreName-Translate (to-dir-format, maintain-extension,
	  nil).
Mode info block (e_interrogate #14 replacement)
Folding

Internet things:
----------------
ZapSGML
ZapMailer (Larch)
ZapTerm (=> ssh for Risc OS)
ZapW3

Other:
------
CVS for Risc OS
RCS support internal to Zap (or external using a service call?)
Other IDE functions? Source browsing, etc.?				Necessary?
