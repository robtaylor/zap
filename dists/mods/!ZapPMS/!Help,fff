               ZapPMS, a Zap syntax colouring mode
               ====================================

1.0 Features
============

This module performs syntax colouring designed for PMS documents.

Philip's Music Scribe (PMS) is a computer program for typesetting high
quality music.  Demonstration versions are available from HENSA or
on CD ROM as CDFS::RISC_DISC2.$.COMMERCIAL.PMS.

The module contains some enhancements to the cursor keys so that
when they are used in combination with the shift key they behave in a
more appropriate manner than when is in text mode.  These routines have
been stolen from Martin Ebourne's C mode and are documented by him in
his own directory.  Briefly they make the shift-cursor combinations
pause more frequently and more intelligently step through the code.
Martin has kindly given permission for his code to be used.

It also contains C mode style bracket matching.

Note that the settings for the delay (in centiseconds) may range
over the even numbers only from zero to 62.

Setting this to zero turns the option off. It also defaults to off, so
you will need to configured it via the mode menu before it will do
anything.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no cliam that it is bug-free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all it is
redistributed intact.  If engaging in large-scale distribution, it is
requested that you contact the author before doing so to obttain his
permission to do this.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the module "ZapPMS" into an appropriately-named subdirectory of
the "3rdParty" directory inside the Zap application.

In the file called "External", in the directory "!Zap.Options.Default" or
wherever the variable Zap$External points to, add lines as follows:

<Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.ZapPMS
	PMS

...and the line:

&500    &FFF    \#\*.PMS.\#\*		+PMS

...in your keys file.  Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 Problems
============

                              Mode problems:
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bracket matching gets confused by brackets embedded in strings.

                       Syntax colouring problems:
 		       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PMS is not an easy language to syntax colour correctly.

ZapPMS does not colour strings split across lines correctly.

Some of the colouring has been done in ignorance of the program's syntax.
Comments are welcome.

If you know anything about PMS, then you can probably improve this mode
by remote control by emailing tt@cryogen.com with your comments.

4.0 History
===========

v0.06 - (09-Feb-96)
      * Commands which wrap between lines are now coloured correctly.
      * The code for detecting \...\ sequences has been modified so this works
        between lines.  &... sequences and ( ... ) brackets can still cause
        more minor problems when wrapped, however.
      * The last menu entry has been changed to only represent the '/'
        character.  The other characters which were here are now represented
        by the 'Foreground' colour - make sure the 'All modes' option is not
        ticked when editing this.

v0.05 - (31-Jan-96)
      * A minor change the ']' character is now recognised as stopping
        all commands.

v0.04 - (20-Jan-96)
      * Bugfix: insertions of multiple characters is no longer in
        conflict with the bracket matching code.
      * Bugfix: clicking on the mode menu entry leading to the
        "Pause" writable menu no longer crashes Zap.

v0.03 - (17-Jan-96)
      * Made the & operator inoperative in strings.  This seemed to be
        inappropriate more often than it was appropriate.
      * Made \...\ sequences slightly more choosy about what they enclose
        to remove an observed problem.
      * Removed lots of irrelevant hexadecimal number code which was
        causing occasional miscolourings.
      * Added more menu options for different kinds of brackets.
      * Completely changed the method used to check for / ... /
        sequences.  This new method may nat always get things right,
        but it certainly does better than the old one in most cases.
      * Sorry if the default colours are more garish than they used to be.
        
v0.02 - (14-Jan-96)
      * Small number of changes based on a comprehensive user's wishlist.

v0.01 - (09-Jan-96)
      * Very early release to essentially one person.
