No guarantee is made as to the reliability/stability of any part of Zap.

You may distribute Zap freely; however we request that you do not
distribute Zap, except as you received it. This request is made in
order to try to ensure that the options remain in their default state,
and all help text is included. This should help make Zap easier to use
for subsequent receivers of the program.

IN PARTICULAR THERE SHOULD BE NO !CONFIG FILE IN ANY DISTRIBUTED VERSION.
PLEASE DELETE YOUR !CONFIG FILE BEFORE DISTRIBUTING.

In addition, if you wish to put Zap on a CD ROM, or in some other software
compilation, please contact us at one of the addresses below so that we can
ensure that the software you ship is as fully-featured and -functional as
possible.

Dominic Symes, the primary author, developed the program and was its sole
maintainer until the end of 1996. The program is now being maintained by a
group of `Zap developers'. Currently, these are principally Darren Salt and
James Aylett; please contact them if you need any support.

Please note that Zap is nothing to do with the employers of any of the Zap
developers.
