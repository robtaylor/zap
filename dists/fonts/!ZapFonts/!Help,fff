!ZapFonts version 1.03 (04-Nov-00)
==================================

!ZapFonts is a central resource containing the ZapRedraw module, and the
bitmap fonts which go with it. It also contains documentation describing
how to interface other applications with the facilities provided, a utility
for manipulating the fonts and convertion programs which allow fonts to
be imported and exported.

This resource is intended to complement the outline font resource, !Fonts,
which is present on (almost) everybody's machine.

Typically you should place it somewhere in your boot sequence and ensure
that it is booted before anything that needs it (Boot:Resources for people
with Risc PC boot sequences).

ZapRedraw is (c) Copyright Dominic Symes.
!ZapFonts is maintained by James Aylett (dj@zap.tartarus.org). If you have
fonts you would like to contribute to ZapFonts then please get in touch
with him.

Currently the ZapRedraw module does not have the functionality of the Acorn
Outline Font Manager; it is intended to add suitable commands and SWIs in
the future. In particular, future versions of ZapRedraw will provide calls
to list available fonts.
