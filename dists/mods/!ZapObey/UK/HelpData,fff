Tim Tyler's Obey file colouring mode.
For more details there is a help file available.

BEAUTIFY
This command converts operating system commands in obey files into a
sensible pattern of upper and lower case.
 
It is only really of any use in Obey files.

OBEY_FLAGSTOGGLE <word>
This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.
