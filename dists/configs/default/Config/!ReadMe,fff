FileIdHigh : High priority mappings from file content to modes.

The TypesHigh, TypesLow FileIdHight and FileIdLow files are combined
with additional information from any Zap modules present in
order to determine which files are loaded into which modes.

The TypesHigh and FileIdHigh files should only ever need to be used
to override any conflicts between different extensions over
which mode loads particular files.
