mode_email
Darren Salt's colour email/news mode.
Colours can be configured from the display menu.
The mode can be configured from its submenu in the modes menu.
See its help text for more details.

EMAIL_FIXSIG
In Email mode, fixes the sig separator (if broken). It is also called
automatically prior to saving. (If 'Ignore .sig separator' is enabled, does
nothing.)

EMAIL_STRIPSPCS
In Email mode, performs space and quoting altering according to <word>. The
header and sig separator are left unmodified.
b0 = strip spaces at eol
b1 = strip tabs at eol
b2 = tabify
b3 = strip quoting from otherwise blank lines
b4 = convert quoting to standard form
b5-b31 are reserved
The header and sig separator are unmodified (except possibly by the tabify
function).

EMAIL_STAMP
In Email mode, will generate a new date line and message ID.
Requires a valid "From: " line and that the "Date: " and "Message-ID: " lines
are present. (If 'Ignore header' is enabled, does nothing.)

EMAIL_DATE
In Email mode, will generate a new date line.
Requires that the "Date: " line is present. (If 'Ignore header' is enabled,
does nothing.)

EMAIL_CHANGEQUOTING
In Email mode, will change the quoting for the paragraph (starting from the
current line) to the specified character (supplied as a string parameter) or
the next keypress.

EMAIL_FLAGSTOGGLE
Alters some of the Email mode flags for the current window or the default
options (see also Email_MoreFlagsToggle). The window will be redrawn if any
display options have been altered. The <word> is as for WFlags_Toggle.

EMAIL_MOREFLAGSTOGGLE
Alters some of the Email mode flags for the current window or the default
options (see also Email_FlagsToggle). The window will be redrawn if any
display options have been altered. The <word> is as for WFlags_Toggle.

EMAIL_SPLITFORINSERT
In Email mode, splits the text, ensuring that there are n blank lines, and
places the cursor on the second one.
n is a byte parameter, and defaults to 3.

EMAIL_INCQUOTING
In Email mode, increments the quoting level of the selected region, using the
specified character (string parameter) or the next keypress.

EMAIL_DECQUOTING
In Email mode, decrements the quoting level of the selected region.

EMAIL_ROTENCODE
Performs Rot13 encoding on the current selection, or, if none, at the cursor.

EMAIL_ROTENCODECUR
Performs Rot13 encoding at the cursor.

EMAIL_SETFORMATMOD
Sets the format width modifier, for the current window or the default
options, to the given byte value.

EMAIL_SETQUOTING
Sets the non-standard quoting characters to the supplied string. Null string
= default :"|

EMAIL_ADDQUOTINGCHR
Adds the supplied character (as a string) or the next keypress to the
non-standard quoting character list.

EMAIL_REMQUOTINGCHR
Removes the supplied character (as a string) or the next keypress from the
non-standard quoting character list.

EMAIL_ADDTAGLINE
Adds a tagline to the bottom of the message.
On repeated action, the previous tagline is removed.

EMAIL_ADDSIGNATURE
Adds a signature to the bottom of the message, replacing any already there.
The sigs file is determined by the user name and whether the file is a news
article.

EMAIL_NEXTSIGNATURE
Adds the next signature from the current .sigs file (regardless of file,
From: header, or whether you're editing mail or news) to the bottom of the
message, replacing any already there.
 
If a non-zero parameter is supplied, then the nth signature is used.
 
If no .sig file is already in use, then this behaves as Email_AddSignature.

EMAIL_EDITTAGLINES
Loads the taglines file for editing.

EMAIL_EDITSIGFILES
Opens the signatures directory.
If you've been warned about a bad signatures file, then the next use of this
command will (try to) load that file.

EMAIL_SNIP
Snips the selected text, preserving quoting in the last line, and inserts
either the supplied string or, if blank, "[snip]".

EMAIL_DECODEQP
Decodes MIME quoted printable. Removes appropriate header lines if the
supplied word parameter is zero.

EMAIL_ENCODEQP
Encodes as MIME quoted printable (except in the header and .sig separator).
Adds suitable header lines.

EMAIL_ENCODE8BIT
Encodes as MIME 8bit. Adds suitable header lines.

EMAIL_DECODEQPSEL
Applies immediate quoted-printable decoding to the selected text, if it's in
the current buffer. No header lines are removed.

EMAIL_ENCODEQPSEL
Applies immediate quoted-printable encoding to the selected text, if it's in
the current buffer. No header lines are added.

EMAIL_BUTTONS
Selects the given button pane (via byte parameter). If the parameter = 255
then the default pane is set to the current pane instead.

EMAIL_RETURNRECEIPTTO
Inserts a Return-Receipt-To: line in the header, using the address in the
From: line. Works with mail and CC'd news.

EMAIL_ANTISPAM
Given a string parameter "<x> <y>", will replace string <x> with <y> in your
From: line. In news, it also ensures the presence of ".invalid" (as required
by grandson-of-RFC1036).

EMAIL_ADDHEADERLINE
Given a parameter "Header: line", will add the header or replace an existing
one. Prefix with '@' for mail only, or '.' for news only.

EMAIL_EXECSCRIPT
Executes a script containing a list of Zap commands. The script file is
determined by the user name.
