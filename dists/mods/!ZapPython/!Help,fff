               ZapPython, a Zap syntax colouring mode
               ======================================


This is a syntax colouring mode for the Python programming language.
It is based on Tim Tylers (tt@cryogen.com) Perl mode, version 0.15.
The only difference is that the Perl keywords have been replaced by the
Python ones and auto indentation now reacts on ":".

Thanks to him for allowing distribution.

For more information see the Helpfile of !ZapPerl.
