1.0 Features
============

There is only one minor feature apart from the very simple colouring:

If the tab character is set to 44 (",") then any commas are displayed in
a /slightly/ more sensible manner than normal.

If this behaviour is considered suitable then this can be saved as the
default configuration.  Unfortunately, commas in comments and strings are
not immune from this :-(


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !ZapCSV application into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 What it does and does not do
================================

The module contains all kinds of fancy low level code to try to provide
variable width tabbing based on the comma character.

However this code is currently broken and to protect the user from this,
none of it is firing at the moment.

Currently, comments are considered to be any lines which start with a "%"
symbol.

It expects strings to be quoted, and tends to colour unquoted strings in
an unfortunate manner.  I plan to fix this...
