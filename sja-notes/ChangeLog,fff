Change Log	(sja, post v1.40)
----------

99/01/14	&322 executed on startup
		opt_switches b31 => execute &322 even when we're loading files on init
			(E-Vars changed)
99/01/15	MISCOPS 19 to configure opt_switches b31 (Menus and HelpData changed)
		More little bugfixes to token/message use
99/01/19	Started replacing constants with symbols in the source:
		Exceptions, Fonts, Heap, Mode2, Mode3, ModuleBits, Update done.
99/01/20	More of the above.
99/01/21	Will now build properly under Unix (just missing a fully-functional AS).
		stop_operation called as necessary on mouse click in text window
		moved Menus around slightly; 0-9 internal, 10-19 internal mode, 20+ user
		Menu 05 is now "Selection"; shift+alt+ when there's a selection brings
		it up (otherwise alt+ action - Modes menu)
		(The last two mean that the Menus files will all have to change.)
