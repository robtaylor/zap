          !ReadMe for Zap's 'Generated' directory...

These files have been automatically generated by the 'CreateConf' program.

Zap uses CreateConf to provide plug-and-play installation of modules by
automatically generating its configuration files when it needs to do so.

The files here should not normally be edited directly - if they are any
changes will probably be lost the next time there is a change in the
configuration files.

Each included file is prefixed by a short note to say where the original
document it came from is located - these are the files that may be edited
by the user.
