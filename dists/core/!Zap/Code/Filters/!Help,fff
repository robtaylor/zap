This software is COPYRIGHT, but has been released as FREEWARE. Please see the
end of this file for conditions of use and distribution.

The programs in ZF: (Filters.Code) are written to be run by FILTERSEL (in the
module ZapUtils). They may be written in BASIC, or a compiled language such
as C.

The help text is in ZFHelp: (Filters.Docs); each file must have the same
leafname as the filter it contains help on.


Writing your own programs
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

A skeleton BASIC program "Filt_Shell" is supplied for you to build your own
programs around.


Preparing the programs for use
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

None necessary, unless you run !Zap from floppy, in which case you'll need to
edit Filters.!Run appropriately (just follow the instructions).
