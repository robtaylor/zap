MenuConf 0.4
============

© 1999, 2000 James Aylett.

MenuConf provides a simple interface to reconfiguring Zap's menus. It reads
the source menus file, generates a list of options, lets you choose which to
turn on and off, and then runs MakeMenus with those options to generate the
final menus file.

Note that Zap cannot reload its Menus file in mid-session.

MenuConf [options] [--output OUTFILE] [[--input] INFILE]

  -i, --input INFILE      source file read from INFILE; stdin used if not given
                          if -i not given, a single argument will be used
  -o, --output OUTFILE    final menu file written to OUTFILE

  -c, --country COUNTRY   sets the country to use when auto-finding files
  -g, --generator FILE    sets the MakeMenus executable to use
  -f, --configfrom FILE   read defaults from MakeMenus-generated FILE
  -E, --extraopts OPTIONS extra options to pass through to MakeMenus

  -n, --noprompt          don't prompt; just use defaults from source file
  -h, --help              display this help message and quit
  -V, --version           display version string and quit

Bug reports etc.
