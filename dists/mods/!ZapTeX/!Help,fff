1.0 Features
============

Syntax colouring for LaTeX files with some support for TeX.

Command completion for many LaTeX command macros.

2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !ZapTeX application into the !Zap.Modules directory, then 
restart Zap.

3.0 What it does and does not do
================================

It syntax-colours LaTeX files.

It has a (long) list of LaTeX and TeX commands which it recognises,
and colours appropriately, but because of the massive scope of the language
it will not always get things right.  If this irritates you then you can set
'recognised command' colour and the 'unrecognised command' to be the same
as one another.

Command completion is available.  The leading '\' and the first (few)
letter(s) of a command may be typed and then '.' pressed.  For example
'\section' may be entered as '\s.'

There is currently a special colour reserved for commands with @s in them.
This is of little relevance in LaTeX itself, but can help when viewing files
in related formats.

There are a number of commands originally written by Elliot Hughes' for his
LaTeX mode.


4.0 : Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* \@ is not currently coloured correctly.
* The $ ... $ bracket matching works poorly - it doesn't work back to the
  start of the line to see if there have been an even number of $ and $$
  constructs.
* It pays no attention to '\begin{verbatim} ... \end{verbatim}'-like
  structures and gaily carries on colouring the contents of these as though
  they were still LaTeX.
