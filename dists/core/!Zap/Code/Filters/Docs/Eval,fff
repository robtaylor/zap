 Eval - Version 1.20 © Stephen Revill, 7th May 1998
-==================================================-

This little program simply replaces an expression with an answer. The
expression must conform to ARM BASIC's expression syntax (as it uses
EVAL to generate an answer). Using variables in expressions will have
unpredictable results.

If you prefix the expression with a ~ it will be evaluated and the
anser given as hex (eg: ~254+1  will give  &ff). Likewise, you can use
' to return a 32 bit binary value. Note: the prefix must be the first
character of the expression.

To return a string, you must prefix the expression with a $. For
example, if you select $TIME$ then run Eval, you will get the time and
date.

The program at this point takes no parameters.
