| This is a file to set various variables needed by ZapDWExt

| You may alter it as you wish, but it is definitely unwise to use
| commands which overwrite application workspace, as Zap could be
| seriously offended...

| Search path for OPENMEMBER command:
| Alter the next line to point to all the places where you keep header files.
Set ZapDWS$Path ZapCurDir:,ZapCurDir:^.,C:,C:ansi.

| Default options for CC command:
| Alter the next line to suit your needs. In particular, you may wish to
| add more libraries to the list after -L.
Set Zap$CCOptions -IC: -throwback -Lc:o.dwlib,c:o.stubs,c:o.smallrol -Desktop ^

| Default options for AMU command:
| _I_ don't have standard options for amu, so the next line is commented out,

|Set Zap$AmuOptions
