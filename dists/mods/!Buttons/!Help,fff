     ZapButtons is a modeless extension to Zap which provides toolbars attached
to Zap's editing windows. These toolbars can be created and enabled independantly 
for each of Zap's editing modes by providing a couple of files.


Installation
------------

To install, copy the !Buttons aplication into the !Zap.Modules directory. Zap
will then need to be restarted.

Note that many modes will normally have their buttons option turned off by
default. This can be reconfigured as required from the 'Options' in Zap's icon
bar menu.


Technical
---------

Buttons are enabled by setting b12 of w_info. When Zap created an editing
window, it check if this bit is set, and if so executed the command
BUTTONS_START. This causes ZapButtons to be loaded, and a pane attached to the
window.

To provide a button bar, a few files must be provided. ZapButtons expects to
find files called Templates, Sprites, Scripts and possibly Menus in a directory
Zap<mode>:Buttons. Thus in your mode's !StartUp file you should set the variable
Zap<mode>$Path to point to a list of directories to be checked for buttons bars.
I recommend that this search path includes ZapUser:Modules.<mode> so that users
can arrange for alternative button bars to be used.

The Templates file contains the window definition for the buttons bar. Up to 4
buttons bars may be provided, defined by templates called buttons0 .. buttons3 -
the names are case sensitive. The command BUTTONS_CHANGE is used to swap between
them.

The Sprites file contains the sprites to be used by the buttons bars.

The Menus file gives a menu to be used on the Button bar, in the standard Zap
format. The initial menu used has a handle of 0. If this file is not present,
ZapButtons will use the mode's mode menu instead.


Scripts
-------

The format of the command scripts files is as follows:

Sections begin with "<BUTTONSn>" or "(BUTTONSn)" where n is the number of the
button bar concerned.

Each section consists of a series of entries, one for each icon in the
relevant button bar's template.  These are in the same order as the icons
are stored in the template file.

An entry begins with a series of lines of Zap commands.  These may be in the
form of a colon-separated list.

If a line is prefixed by a '%' then the window the button bar is attached
to is not given the input focus before the line of commands is executed
(this normally happens automatically).

If Zap doesn't have the input focus then the commands are normally executed
on the window the button bar is attached to, using the most recent cursor
position in the document for any insertions/deletions.  However this depends
to some extent on whether the commands involved require this information. If
they don't then there are circumstances when the commands may be issued on
other windows, (see E-Command for details of the circumstances) so only use
'%'s if you're sure you know what you're doing, and then with caution.

Any lines prefixed by a '$' are not 'learned' by Zap.

If more than one prefix is present on a line, then any %s must precede any $s.

Lastly there is a section of interactive help.  This is is a line prefixed with
a | character. This line has any leading spaces stripped from it and is then fed
to providers of interactive help upon request.

The section is terminated by a single - character on a line.
