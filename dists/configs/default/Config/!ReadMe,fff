!Config	  : Zap's Configuration options (note that this
	      file should *not* be present in any
	      distributed version of Zap).

!ReadMe   : This file.
!ZapBoot  : Executed when Zap is first seen.  By default
	      Zap is set up to only claim filetpypes,
	      TaskWindows, etc if other applications
	      have not already claimed them.
	      Edit this file, following the instructions
	      inside it to change this.
!ZapBooted : Executed when Zap is first seen, after !ZapBoot
		has completed. This is used to tidy up any
		system variables set during !ZapBoot's operation.
!ZapRun	  : Executed when Zap starts up.  This normally
	      sets up the location of the Templates and
	      other configuration files.
ClickSend : Instructions for dealing with alt-double-clicks.
Country   : Obey file used to set Zap's country setting. May be omitted.
External  : Description of the format of the External file.
FileIdHigh: High priority regulary expression mode identifiers
Keys	  : Dir containing per-country main Zap key map definitions.
Menus	  : Dir containing per-country files describing Zap's menu structure.
FileIdLow : Low priority regulary expression mode identifiers
Settings  : Search macros and other miscellaneous variables.
TMFs      : Dir containing user and core mode Textual Mode Files.
TypesHigh : High priority mappings from filetypes and paths to modes.
TypesLow  : Low priority mappings from filetypes and paths to modes.

The TypesHigh, TypesLow, FileIdHigh and FileIdLow files are combined
with additional information from any Zap modules present in
order to determine which files are loaded into which modes.

The TypesHigh and FileIdHigh files should only ever need to be used
to override any conflicts between different extensions over
which mode loads particular files.
