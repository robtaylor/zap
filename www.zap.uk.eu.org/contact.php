<h3><a name="ds">Darren Salt</a></h3>

<p>Darren maintains ZapEmail, ZapDS and sometimes ZapBASIC. In the core, he is responsible (amongst other things) for the command language, ClickSend, menus, internationalisation, and mode handling (including clone modes). He's also responsible for ZapRedraw's Viewfinder support.</p>

<a href="mailto:ds@zap.tartarus.org">ds@zap.tartarus.org</a>

<h3><a name="sja">James Aylett</a></h3>

<p>James maintains ZapFonts, the combined command extensions (although, to some extent, this is a shared responsibility), the 'glue' (documentation, web and ftp sites, domain, mailing lists), and an air of omniscience. He is also responsible (amongst other things) for c-vars and the general shape of the distribution.</p>

<h3><a name="christian">Christian Ludlam</a></h3>

<p>Christian maintains ZapRedraw and is responsible for driving that in the direction it's going. In Zap proper he fritters his time away fixing bugs, dreaming up wonderful ideas for the future, and correcting James' mistakes.</p>

<h3><a name="tmt">Tim Tyler</a></h3>

<p>Tim did lots of the work on v1.40, including coordinating its release. He also wrote vast numbers of syntax colouring modes, and maintained Martin's programming modes. Since v1.40 Tim has decided to try to use his time more wisely (:-), and avoid getting dragged into Zap too much.</p>

<h3><a name="jrf">Justin Fletcher</a></h3>

<p>Justin is responsible for enhancing Code mode beyond common sense, and a few other things. He's currently suffering from lack of time to devote to Zap (if 'suffering' is really the right word).</p>

<h3><a name="dhs">Dominic Symes</a></h3>

<p>Dominic was the initial developer of Zap, and its sole maintainer until the end of 1996.<!-- Dominic now works at ARM Ltd (and doesn't have much time for Zap things - in general you should not direct queries to him); please note that Zap has nothing to do with ARM.--></p>
<!-- Dominic.Symes@armltd.co.uk; Dominic Symes, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd, Fulbourn Road, Cherry Hinton, Cambridge CB1 4JN, UK -->

<h3><a name="mje">Martin Ebourne</a></h3>

<p>Martin wrote the C, C++, Java, Assembler and Pascal modes which form much of the use of Zap (at least by its current developers). He also wrote the plug and play auto-configuration system we've been using since v1.40.</p>
