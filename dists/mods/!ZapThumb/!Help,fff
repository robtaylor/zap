     This mode acts very much like Code mode, except it disassembles Thumb
code rather than ARM code. Most of the operations that can be performed in
Code mode, such as following branches with the cursor right key, will also
work in Thumb mode - the exception is altering instructions, since there is
no code present to assemble Thumb instructions yet.


Changelog
---------

0.01 27-Nov-02	Created

0.02 15-Feb-05	Added e_lineoff entry to set the cursor width correctly

		Now decodes LDR Rd,[PC,#offset] when cursor right pressed to
		jump to the location referenced.

		Passes the previous instruction to the disassembler when
		redrawing to make sure it can decode BL (which is a two
		instruction sequence) properly regardless of where redraw 
		starts. This hadn't been a problem because the Debugger 
		module copes with the problem very gracefully.
