     This mode acts very much like Code mode, except it disassembles Thumb
code rather than ARM code. Most of the operations that can be performed in
Code mode, such as following branches with the cursor right key, will also
work in Thumb mode - the exception is altering instructions, since there is
no code present to assemble Thumb instructions yet.
