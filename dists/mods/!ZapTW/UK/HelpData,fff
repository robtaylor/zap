TASKWINDOW_CONTROL (ZapTaskwindow Tim Tyler)
This is used to suspend and unlink TaskWindows.

  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 1 - Resume
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 2 - Unlink
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 3 - Relink
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 4 - Kill
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 5 - Resurrect
 
When a Taskwindow is unlinked the task continues to execute, but no input is
possible and no screen ouput is shown.
