			The ConfigScan program

CreateConf checks date stamps on the configuration files it examines
in order to determine whether to rebuild Zap's configuration files.

ConfigScan checks date stamps and ensures that the same set of files and
directories are present in the 'Generated' and 'Modules' directory as the
last time it was run.  If there have been any changes to the configuration
then it sets a flag which Zap used to determine whether CreateConf needs
calling.

It is written in hand crafted, fairly well optimised machine code for
maximum speed.

It maintains caches of the current status at ZapGenerated:ScanBootC
and ZapGenerated:ScanRunC - these are in a fairly self-explanatory
format.  The hex numbers are the time-stamps of the associated files.

Hopefully CreateConf will be able to make use this cache at some point in
the future.

ConfigScan is (C) Tim Tyler 1997 - it may only be distributed with Zap.
