1.0 Features
============

Syntax colouring for Makefiles.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !MakeFile application into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 What it does
================

It syntax-colours make files.  Historically make is a command line tool
which originated on unix systems to assist management of programming
projects.

Make files do not really have a well-defined format across a range of
target platforms.


4.0 : Problems
==============

Mainly oriented around Acorn-style make files.

In particular there is not currently any support for the primitive foo.c or
foo/c naming conventions widely in use on other platforms.

Objects with '-' in them are always rendered as if they were switches.


5.0 : Early history
===================

v0.02 - (10-May-1998)
      * *Help now works.
      * The mode now never makes visual modifications to displayed switches.

v0.01 - (03-Apr-1998)
      * First released version.
