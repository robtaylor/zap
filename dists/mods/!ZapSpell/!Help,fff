Features
--------

The module provides an interface between Zap and the 'Impress'n Spell'
spell-checking module (supplied).  It provides spell-checking of entire files 
and selections, and can also perform spell checking dynamically, as you type. 
It offers an interface using throwback of misspelled words and a misspelled
word dialogue.


Operation
---------

The front end may be activated by the SPELL command.  This brings up a window
which has a number of action buttons on it.

The top of the window shows the word being examined. This word will be selected
in the file, and the cursor placed after it.

Underneath that there is a list of possible suggestions. You can click on
these words to copy them into the writable icon; double clicking also causes
the same action as the Replace button. 

A writable icon follows, where the word to be replaced may be typed. As you type
into this icon, the list of suggestions is updated.

"Replace" replaces the selected word with the contents of the writable icon and
moves onto the next misspelled word.

"Add" permanently adds the word to the user dictionary. To remove a word later, 
see the IMPRESSONSPELL_DELWORD command.

"Ignore" ignores this word and moves onto the next.

"Cancel" cancels the spell check and moves the cursor back to where it was when
the spell check began.


Certain keypresses also control the spell checker: cR, cA, cI and cC operate the
Replace, Add, Ignore and Cancel functions respectively. Escape will also close 
the dialogue.
