	!ReadMe for Zap's 'Code.Config' directory...

This directory contains two programs, and their configuration and help files.

			ConfigScan
			~~~~~~~~~~
Zap first uses ConfigScan to detect whether any of its configuration files
need to be rebuilt.  If they do, it then calls CreateConf.  More details
are available in the 'Code.Config.ScanHelp' file.

			CreateConf
			~~~~~~~~~~
Zap uses CreateConf to provide plug-and-play installation of modules by
automatically generating its configuration files when it needs to do so.
More details are available in the 'Code.Config.CreateHelp' file.
