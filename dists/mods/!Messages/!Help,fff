              ZapMsg, a syntax colouring mode for Messages files
              ==================================================

This mode has no documentation of its own, (apart from this file).

This mode shares a number of features with the Obey mode and you are referred
to this as a source of relevant documentation.

It supports Zap spell and avoids quering users about the spelling of
tokens, and is intelligently aware that words starting with "|M", "%s", "\S"
and, (by convention) "`z" actually start with the letter following this
sequence.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he makes no
cliam that it is bug free and, it is not guaranteed to perform any particular
function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

The module if Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all files
remain intact.

To install, it is recommended that you use something like:

<Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!Messages.ZapMsg Obey <Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!Messages.!Setup
        Messages
        -
        MESSAGES_FLAGSTOGGLE
        -

...In the file called "External", in the directory "!Zap.Options.Default" or 
wherever the variable Zap$External points to, and lines a bit like:

&5xx    &FFF    \#\*.Messages		+Messages
&5xx    &FFF    \#\*.Messages.\o\*	+Messages

...in your "Keys" file.  It might be worth noting here that while there is
not a specific mode available for 'MakeFile's, many of these appear to be
treated and coloured quite well by this mode.

Zap will then need to be restarted.

Features
~~~~~~~~
As well as the syntax colouring this mode supports the Window-wrap and
SoftWrap options.  It also has a primitive button bar.

SoftWrap
~~~~~~~~
The SoftWrap option allows different cursor editing options to suit the
taste of the user:

 * The 'Physical' option affects whether ctrl-cursor operations work on
     physical or logical lines (with SoftWrap only).
 * The 'Confine' option affects whether cursor movement is confined to
     the region containing text (currently with SoftWrap only).
 * The 'Smart' option affects whether shift-cursor operations work using
     Martin Ebourne's intelligent cursor movement code.

It uses SoftWrap mode as a minor mode to perform its soft-wrapping action.
This is loaded, if needed, in order to use the fuctions it provides.

Note that this needs a recent version of SoftWrap mode to work properly.

Command
~~~~~~~
MESSAGES_FLAGSTOGGLE <word>
This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.
