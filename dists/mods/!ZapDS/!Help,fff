Installation
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

Drop !ZapDS into !Zap.Modules and (quit and re)load Zap...


Commands
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

Commands without any specified syntax take no parameters.

Any commands which take a string parameter will open the minibuffer if no
parameter is supplied.

A "Zap expression" is a string which is evaluated by OS_EvaluateExpression
but which may contain Zap functions.


DS_AdrL
———————

Assembles a long (two instruction) ADR.

Syntax: DS_AdrL "[<condition code>] <register>,<address>"

Example:
	at address &1000, the command
		DS_AdrL "LT R1,&5344"
	is equivalent to
		Assemble "ADRLT R1,&1344"
		Assemble "ADDLT R1,R1,#&4000"
(It will of course use SUB if required.)


DS_AdrX
———————

Assembles a very long (three instruction) ADR, much as DS_AdrL does - it even
has the same syntax.


DS_Add, DS_Sub, DS_Rsb, DS_And, DS_Or, DS_Eor
——————  ——————  ——————  ——————  —————  ——————

These commands perform an arithmetic or logic operation on the current byte
(or word, if in word or code mode). Each takes a Zap expression as a
parameter; it must evaluate to a number. (Even if the byte/word is unchanged,
the cursor is moved on.)

For example, to add &180 to a word (in word mode), you'd use
	DS_Add "&180"


DS_SWItoName
————————————

This takes an SWI number, found at the cursor position, and replaces it with
the corresponding name. In BASIC and BASTXT modes, quotation marks are
automatically inserted.


DS_SWItoNumber
——————————————

This takes an SWI name, found at the cursor position, and replaces it with
the corresponding number. In BASIC and BASTXT modes, surrounding quotation
marks are automatically removed.

know so I can fix it, but I'm not taking any responsibility. (Besides,
there's no point in sueing me since I've got next to no money.)

operation, documentation, and/or conditions of use without notice in any way
I see fit. Hopefully it will be an improvement.
