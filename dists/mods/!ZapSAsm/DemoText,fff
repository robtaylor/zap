\ Colour demonstration... no, it's not supposed to be run...

\ Colours are personal things.. I mean, how do I know whether the blue
\ that you see and the blue that I see look the same..?
\ However, if you prefer less of the philosophy, you might just want to
\ change the colours so they look less garish.  In my defence, I have
\ to point out that I set the defaults to be similar in character to the
\ colour modes already written.. I use different colours myself (well,
\ for a start, I use a white background, so cream's definitely out..)

\ if you're a less exciting soul (or alternatively, more tasteful) then
\ you could set all the logical mode colours to the same physical colour
\ (grey, say) .. see if I care if you shun all my hard work.. :-)
