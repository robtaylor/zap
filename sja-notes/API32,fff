		Zap 1.45 -> 1.46 API changes
		----------------------------


Function calls
--------------

	+ is a new register
	- register no longer useful
	! register contents or meaning chaged

	In each case, the _new_ API is in the E- files.


Zap_BuildMenu[WithHelp] = build_menu[with_help]

	+ R6 = flags word for each menu entry (see E-Menu)
	       Can be changed by the sub but be careful.


Zap_CharDelDispatch = char_del_dispatch

	+ R0 b31 now contains the b31 flag previously in R3
	! R3 no longer contains this flag


Zap_WhichMode = find_file_mode

	! R1 no longer contains a flag in b31
	+ R2 all bits become flag. ie. equality with 0 is now
	     tested as opposed to just b31.

	This has also affected get_file_mode without changing
	its API. This function is exported in the dispatch table
	but not documented in E-ZapCalls.


Zap_MiniPrompt      = minibuffer_prompt
Zap_MiniPropmtToken = ninibuffer_prompt_token

	! R0 no longer contains "don't append ':'" flag.
	
	Rationale: there were only two instances of this flag being set in
	the sources, and one was 'for want of a better solution'. The flag
	has been implemented for minibuffer_prompt_and_history only (for
	Oscli etc) but not exported to modes. Use Zap_MiniWrite or
	Zap_Warning or something.


Zap_CommandString = command_string

	! R0 no longer contains DontLearn flag
	+ R1 contains this flag in b31. Other bits reserved and should 
	     be 0



Command entry points
--------------------

	#19 (transient menu ops) no longer called.
