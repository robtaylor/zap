DeDupe - Version 0.01 by Tim Tyler 1998
=======================================

This program 'DeDupes' consecutive lines in  files it is fed, outputting
the resulting file without the duplicated lines.

Triplicated, quadrupled, etc consecutive lines, are also reduced down
to single ones.

It is often useful to 'DeDupe' after sorting regions.  For example,
should you have a mailing list, and want to avoid sending duplicate
copies of your mail to people, you can sort the list, and then 'DeDupe'
it - this should produce the desired result.

Even if you want to maintain the order of the lines, this method can
still be useful for identifying where duplicated lines are, or verifying
that no such lines exist.

The program currently takes no parameters.
