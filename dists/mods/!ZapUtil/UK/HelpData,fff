@ADDRESS (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current address.

@CURSOR (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current cursor position. When there's a split cursor, it returns
car_input, the fixed input cursor; otherwise it will return car_cursor.
This command returns a string of the format "<wind>,<offset>", suitable for
passing to CURSOR.

@CURSORCOLUMN (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current cursor column. When there's a split cursor, it returns
car_input, the fixed input cursor; otherwise it will return car_cursor.

@EVAL <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
<string> = "<base>:<expression>" or "<expression>"
String-returning function equivalent of EVAL.

@EVALH <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
String-returning function equivalent of EVALH.

@INSELECTION (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns TRUE if the cursor is in the selection, FALSE otherwise.

@LINE (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current (logical) line number.

@LINEP (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current (physical) line number.

@SELECTION (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the position of the current selection. This is a string of the format
"<wind>,<start>,<length>", suitable for passing to SELECTION.

@SELSTR (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the selection as a string. Takes a numeric parameter which specifies
the maximum size of selection which you'd like returned - if exceeded, this
will return NULL instead. A parameter of 0 means "any size".

@UEVAL <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
<string> = "<base>:<expression>" or "<expression>"
String-returning function equivalent of UEVAL.

@WINDOW (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Returns the current window number. This can be used with the WINDOW command
to return to this window in future.

CLOSEALL (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Closes all unmodified files.

COMMANDSEL <string> (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Executes the single command <string> with the current selection as parameter.
It is generally better to use <command> $(@SELSTR), because this will pass on
the universal argument, and deal with errors better. COMMANDSEL is
deprecated as a result.

CURSOR (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Sets the cursor from the given string, of the format "<wind>,<offset>". It also
sets the cursor mode to 1 (standard editing).

CURSORCOLUMN (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Sets the cursor column from the given number, and sets the cursor mode to 1
(standard editing).

DISCARDALL (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Closes all files, modified or not. No prompts.

DISCARDTASKWINDOWS (ZapUtil - Daniel Wagenaar)
Kills all taskwindows without prompting the user.

DISCARDTHROWBACKS (ZapUtil - Daniel Wagenaar)
Kills all throwback windows without prompting the user.

EVAL <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
<string> = "<base>:<expression>" or "<expression>"
Evaluates the supplied Zap expression and inserts the signed result in the
supplied base (the exact format is mode dependent).
If the expression evaluates to a string, the base (if supplied) is ignored.

EVALH <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Evaluate the supplied Zap expression and inserts the result as a hexadecimal
number (the exact format is mode dependent).
If it evaluates to a string, the base (if supplied) is ignored.

GOTOADDRESS (ZapUtil - Daniel Wagenaar)
Goes to the given address.

GOTOLINE (ZapUtil - Daniel Wagenaar)
Goes to the given (logical) line.

GOTOLINEP (ZapUtil - Daniel Wagenaar)
Goes to the given (physical) line.

NEXTFILE (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Moves the cursor to the next file in sequence, opening a window for it if
necessary.

NEXTWINDOW (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Moves the cursor to the next window in sequence.

NEXTVIEW (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Moves the cursor to the next view on the current file.

NOTIFYUSER (ZapUtil - Justin Fletcher)
Print the message in a minibuffer window, and pause for a short time.
Note that this command does not function correctly if repeated in a single
command string.

OPENFILE (ZapUtil - Justin Fletcher)
Save the file if changes have been made, then try to open it. Current
applications are given the chance to claim the file before it is run
normally.

RUNAPP (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Save the file if changes have been made, then try to run it as an
application (failing this, the file itself).

SAVEALL (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Saves all modified files; those without full pathnames are ignored. Stops on
error or Zap query.

SAVEANDCLOSEALL (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Saves then closes all modified files; those without full pathnames are
ignored. Stops on error or Zap query.
( = SAVEALL + CLOSEALL)

SAVEANDDISCARDALL (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
Saves all modified files, and closes all files; those without full pathnames
are not saved. Stops on error or Zap query.
( = SAVEALL + DISCARDALL)

SETFILETYPE <word> (ZapUtil - Justin Fletcher)
Sets the file type of the file to <word>.

SETNAME <string> (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Sets the filename to <string>. If <string> is "", then it will search for
the filename in the file; it finds the first instance of "> " and takes from
there to the end of the line as the filename.

SETNAMEINCORE (ZapUtil - James Aylett)
Sets the filename from an in-core string delimited by Zap search expressions
given by the c-vars SetNameStart and SetNameEnd. \-commands are enabled,
macros are disabled. Note that '\' and '/' both need to be quoted in TMFs.

#SetNameStart
Zap search expression used to delimit the start of an in-core filename by
the command SETNAMEINCORE.

#SetNameEnd
Zap search expression used to delimit the end of an in-core filename by
the command SETNAMEINCORE.

UEVAL <string> (ZapUtil - Darren Salt)
<string> = "<base>:<expression>" or "<expression>"
Evaluate the supplied Zap expression and inserts the unsigned result in the
supplied base (the exact format is mode dependent).
If the expression evaluates to a string, the base (if supplied) is ignored.

WINDOWN (ZapUtil - Paul Moore)
Moves the current Zap window down on the screen, by the amount specified
(in OS units).

WINLEFT (ZapUtil - Paul Moore)
Moves the current Zap window left on the screen, by the amount specified
(in OS units).

WINRIGHT (ZapUtil - Paul Moore)
Moves the current Zap window right on the screen, by the amount specified
(in OS units).

WINUP (ZapUtil - Paul Moore)
Moves the current Zap window up on the screen, by the amount specified
(in OS units).
