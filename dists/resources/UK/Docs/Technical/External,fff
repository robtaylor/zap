| Versions of Zap >= 1.3 load extension modes automatically when required
|
| The 'External' file tells Zap which modes and commands are contained in an
| extension module so it knows when to load them.
|
| It should not normally be edited by hand as Zap maintains it itself.
|
| Format of file is:
|
| <filename of module> [<Command to execute before the module loaded>] [*]
|	<list of names of modes in the module>
|	-
|	<list of names of commands in the module> [<flags for command>]
|	-
|	<list of message numbers the module should be loaded to deal with>
|	-
|	<list of extension call base numbers provided by the module>
|	  (See Zap_CallExtension)
|
| If " *" is present at the line end then the module is loaded at startup.
| The OSCLI command (if given) is run via Wimp_StartTask before the module
| is loaded. It usually runs an 'Obey' file which sets up some path names.
|
| NB The 'External' file is very sensitive to errors - inaccurate
| information may lead to crashes!
