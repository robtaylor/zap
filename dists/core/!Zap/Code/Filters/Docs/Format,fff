Format v1.02 (Darren Salt)
˜˜˜˜˜˜

This is a simple text format program written in BASIC.

A paragraph is recognised by either starting with a space, or ending with two
line feeds (this one has both). TAB characters are treated as spaces.

To use, select an area, then press Ctrl-Escape (or your equivalent) and type
the format command, which has the syntax:


 FILTERSEL "ZF:Format
  [-help]
  [-Spaces | -NoSpaces]
  [-Left <n>]
  [-Right <n> | -Width <n>]
  [-Indent <n>]
  [-Blank | -NoBlank]
  [-LeftJustify | -RightJustify | -CEntre | -FullJustify]
  [-BUllet | -NoBUllet]"


 The options are as follows:

 -help			Displays the syntax message and exits

 -spaces	-s	Input paragraphs may start with spaces or 2 linefeeds
 -nospaces	-ns	Input paragraphs may only start with 2 linefeeds

 -left <n>	-l	Left margin, in characters (>= 0, < right margin)

 -right <n>	-r	Right margin (<= 255)
 -width <n>	-w	Width	  (left margin + width <= 255)

 -indent <n>	-i	First line indent (>=0, < right margin)

 -blank		-b	Insert blank line after each paragraph
 -noblank	-nb	Don't insert blank line

 -fulljustify	-fj	Fully justified text
 -leftjustify	-lj	Left justified text
 -rightjustify  -rj	Right justified text
 -centre	-ce	Centred text

 -bullet	-bu	Paragraphs start with bullet points (ignores -indent)
 -nobullet


Default is -spaces -left 0 -right 77 -indent 2 -blank -fulljustify -nobullet

Where options are grouped, only one may be chosen.

Flag specified		Ignored
-rightjustify		-indent, -bullet
-centre			-indent, -bullet
-bullet			-indent
