!ReadMe    - This file.

KillDAreas - Kills off any dynamic areas belonging to Zap.

MakeExtern - Darren's program for rebuilding Zap's 'External' file.
	     This version can rebuild individual modes' External files.
	     Note that this program is mainly of interest to mode authors.

MakeMenus  - Darren's program for rebuilding Zap's 'Menus' file from the
             more convenient source format.

Technical  - Contains one file, E-Library, which is of use to mode authors.
             It also contains E-Template, a rather out of date example of
             how to write Zap extensions. It is strongly advised that if
             you want to write an extension, that you get hold of the source
             for an actual mode or command extension.
