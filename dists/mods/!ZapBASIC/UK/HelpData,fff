| ****************************

mode_basic
Tokenised BASIC editing mode.
Press SHIFT-F8 (RENUMBER) to renumber the program.
Press SHIFT-CTRL-F to run the program.
Press SHIFT-CTRL-E to save and then run the program.

mode_bastxt
Detokenised BASIC editing mode.
This is the same as the text mode except the program is tokenised on saving.
Line numbers are inserted automatically in 1's.
(So error at line 10 means the 10th line in the program).

mode_taskwindow
Taskwindow input/output window.
Most control letter keys and cursor keys are sent to the displayed task.
Function keys and cursor-copying dealt with by Zap.
Change to TEXT mode to suspend the task.
Change back to TASKWINDOW mode to resume the task.
Use ^C (COPYSEL) to copy the selected area to the input stream.
Use ^Q (QUOTE) to force the next character to the task.

ASSEMBLE <string>
Assembles the instruction given by <string>.
Places it at the current cursor position (using its file address).
Assembly is performed by spawning a BASIC program.

BASIC_CHECKBUF (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
Checks the BASIC file for very simple syntax mistakes.
Throwback is generated if there are any possible problems with the file.
Messages currently include:
 "Mismatched quotes"
 "Mismatched brackets"
 "Mismatched braces"
 "THEN with no IF"
 "Trailing spaces after THEN"
The last is not really an error, more a common source of problems.

BASIC_FLAGSTOGGLE <word> (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.

BASIC_REMARK (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This turns the line the cursor is on into a REMark.  This is inserted after
any leading spaces.  The command is probably best used bound to a key as:
BASIC_REMARK:CRIGHT:DOWN:CLEFT - this also moves on to the next line.

BASIC_REMARKSEL (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This executes BASIC_REMARK on every line in the current selection.

BASIC_TWRUN (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This saves the program and then executes it in a TaskWindow.

BASIC_UNREMARK (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This removes the first REMark found in the line (if it exists).
This command is probably best used bound to a key as:
BASIC_UNREMARK:CRIGHT:DOWN:CLEFT - this also moves on to the next line.

BASIC_UNREMARKSEL (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This executes BASIC_UNREMARK on every line in the current selection.

DELWORDLEFT (ZapBASIC Paul Moore)
Deletes one "word", to the left.

DELWORDRIGHT (ZapBASIC Paul Moore)
Deletes one "word", to the right.

TASKWINDOW
Opens a new task window (creating a new task).

TASKWINDOW_CONTROL (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This is used to suspend and unlink TaskWindows.
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 0 - Suspend
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 1 - Resume
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 2 - Unlink
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 3 - Relink
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 4 - Kill
  TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 5 - Resurrect
When a Taskwindow is unlinked the task continues to execute, but no input is
possible and no screen ouput is shown.
When a Taskwindow is suspended execution of it stops temporarily.
Taskwindows may also be suspended by changing out of TaskWindow mode.

TASKWINDOW_FLAGSTOGGLE (ZapBASIC Tim Tyler)
This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.
