		ZapTW -- Taskwindow support for Zap
		===================================


ZapTW provides one mode, which handles taskwindows (for more information on
taskwindows, see the RISC OS User guide). To create a task window use the
'Create->Taskwindow' menu option from the icon bar menu, or press ctrl-F12.

At any time, changing mode to 'Text' will suspend the task, and changing mode
back to 'TaskWindow' will resume it.

There are options on the mode's menu that allow suspension, unlinking and
termination of the task. The 'Die silently' option supresses the modified
file warning when you try to close the window, and the 'Auto close' option
causes the window to close as soon as the task exits.

When unlinked, tasks continue to run independently of the output window,
changing mode will no longer suspend the task, and closing the window or
quitting Zap will no longer terminate it. Note that if an unlinked window is
closed, the only way to kill the task is by using the Task Manager.

The taskwindow output supports the COPY key and the following VDU actions:

	07 CTRL G	Bell.
	08 CTRL H	Move back one character.
	09 CTRL I	Move forward one character.
	10 CTRL J	Move down a line.
	11 CTRL K	Move up a line.
	12 CTRL L	Clear text window.
	13 CTRL M	Move to line start.
	22 CTRL V	Change mode.
	26 CTRL Z	Restore text window.
	28		Define text window.
	30		Home cursor.
	31		Move to x,y (TAB).

If you use Olly Betts' wonderful 'Line Editor' module then you'll find it
works within a Zap taskwindow. Mode changes are reflected by changing the 
width and height of the window.

In general control-letter keys are passed on to the task window and function
keys are not.  The following commands (usually bound to the bracketed keys)
are never passed on: Copy (Copy) Copysel (^C) Movesel (^V) Paste (^Y)
Clearsel (^Z) Quote (^Q).  You can use ^C to copy commands to the active
task.

If you want to send a control key or function key to the taskwindow (which
is not normally passed on) then this can be done by quoting it with CTRL-Q.
For example, CTRL-Q F1 will cause function key F1 to be expanded in the
taskwindow.

Zap makes the width of the window available to tasks running under its
control, so directory listings and *Help output is correctly formatted. (With
other taskwindow controllers, the width of the screen is used which causes
columns to be broken in the wrong place and other nastiness.)
