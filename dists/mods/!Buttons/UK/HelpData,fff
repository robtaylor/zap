mode_buttons
Tim Tyler's mode which provides button bars to Zap.
For more details there is a help file available.

AUTOSAVE <word>
Saves all Zap files at intervals specified by <word> in seconds.
 
This needs ZapTMT v0.03 for TMT_EVENT and ZapDS v0.29 for SAVEALL.

BUTTONS_CHANGE
This changes the number of the button bar which is being displayed.  As its
parameter it takes a single byte.  This is the number of the button bar to
be changed to.
 
This command *only* works from inside buttons scripts.

BUTTONS_CLOSE
This command closes the relevant button bar.  
 
When issued outside a script it closes all buttons associated with a window.

BUTTONS_DELETE
This command deletes the relevant button bar.  The wimp window is deleted
and the button bar is taken off all internal lists.
 
When issued outside a script it deletes all buttons associated with a window.

BUTTONS_FLAGSTOGGLE
For use in changing the options in the mode.  This is designed to be used
on menu entries.  Acts like WFLAGS_TOGGLE.

BUTTONS_MOVE
This command indicates that the button bar may be dragged by this icon.
 
This command *only* works from inside buttons scripts.

BUTTONS_OPEN
Opens a button bar.  For internal use only.

This command is intended for use by other modules when communicating with
ZapButtons. This communication method does not currently seem to operate
correctly and a hacky alternative is currently employed.
