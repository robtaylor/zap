1.0 Features
============

This module provides syntax colouring for Messages files. These are files
used by RISC OS to provide support for internationalisation.

It correctly colours GSTrans sequences like <Obey$Dir>, |G and <255>.

It also supports Zap spell and avoids quering users about the spelling of
tokens, and is intelligently aware that words starting with "|M", "%s", "\S"
and, (by convention) "`z" actually start with the letter following this
sequence.


2.0 Installation 
================

Copy the !Messages application into the Zap.Modules directory, then reload Zap.


3.0 Commands provided
=====================

The module provides one command, MESSAGES_FLAGSTOGGLE, which is used to
control the features provided. You don't need to know what this command does:
it's only used internally tp generate the mode menu.
