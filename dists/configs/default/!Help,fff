!ZapUser version 1.45 (30-08-2002)
=================================

!ZapUser is home to the user settings for Zap. It contains a number of
directories:

	Config		User settings and configuration
	Inserts		Directory for storing common code snippets, etc.
			This can be used with the INSERT command, eg:
			INSERT "ZapInserts:MyHeader".
	Scripts		Directory for storing script files, for use with
			RUNSCRIPT (from ZapJRF).
	Templates	Directory for storing user template sets.
	Tiles		Directory for storing user tile sets.

In addition !ZapUser contains a directory 'Generated', which is used to
store temporary files used by Zap to enable faster startup. (If !ZapUser
isn't writable, Zap will store these in the system temporary file area.)

!ZapUser is intended to be used with Zap 1.36a or later. To use it, either
boot it before you run Zap (in which case Zap will use the options set
contained in !ZapUser), or double-click on !ZapUser and then get Zap to
reload its settings (Reload keys from the Options menu, or the Zap command
ReloadKeys) to change options set. (Note that this won't update the menus -
you need to re-run Zap for that.)

It is advised that you put !ZapUser in Boot:Choices in a RiscPC boot
structure, or somewhere in your own boot sequence where it will be booted
before Zap runs.
