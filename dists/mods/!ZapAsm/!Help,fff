               ZapAsm, a Zap syntax colouring mode
               ====================================

1.0 Features
============

This module performs syntax colouring designed for Assembler documents.
It is designed to work with assemblers that act as preprocessors to the
BASIC assembler, such as JFPatch and SAsm.  It does not currently offer
support for files made with Acorn's ObjAsm assembler.  Nor does it have
anything to do with colouring assembler in BASIC files themselves.

It has bracket matching modelled after the old style C mode.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no claim that it is bug-free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all it is
redistributed intact.  If engaging in large-scale distribution, it is
requested that you contact one of the Zap developers before doing so 
so they can supply the latest version.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !ZapAsm application into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 Problems
============

% symbols may also cause confusion when used in labels.  Sasm's 0ABC hex
convention is not supported, nor its @ prefix for macros.

The bracket matching can get confused by brackets embedded in strings.

Large scale { ... } comments are ignored.

Help text in modules is miscoloured.
