Notes
-----

[1]	DWExt programming things.
Stuff like CC, MAKE et al. These could either go into the programming
extension or be left in their own module. DS prefers the latter (which makes
more sense, providing that MAKE, CC etc. aren't obsoleted by MJE's rewrite of
his similar routines).

Further: Textual Mode Description Files (TMFs) will be implemented by myself
once v1.40 is out. These will allow per-mode configurability of how MAKE,
BUILD, CC etc. work, and these should therefore end up replacing the gamut of
commands we have at the moment. They will end up in ZapProg.

[2]	Core.
Tim doesn't like putting commands into the core when they can comfortably go
elsewhere. I've moved all the ones out of here that I can - the remaining
ones should either go into the core, or remain where they are, IMO. Whatever,
nothing is going to happen here until post v1.40 now.

[3]	ModBrk (sets a breakpoint in a module)

I'm not sure about this ... it seems awfully "hacky". So it can probably
stay where it is (DWExt), at least until all the other bits of DWExt get
nuked.

[5]	REVERT

This was going to go into ZapUtil. Unfortunately the way I think it *should*
work, namely to preserve window positions, means that it has to be more
tightly bound to Zap than is possible in an extension; it's looking likely
that a rewrite of this command will end up in the core at some point.
