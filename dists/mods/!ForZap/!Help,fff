1.0 : Features
==============

Syntax colouring of the Keys, External and HelpData files.
There is also some support for Justin Fletcher's Zap scripts.


2.0 : Installation
==================

Copy !ForZap into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 : What it does and does not do
==================================

It syntax-colours files of Zap commands.

The various files it tries to colour are in a number of different formats
and the colouring used is a bit of a compromise solution that looks quite
good with all the files.  The mode auto-detects whether the keys file is
being edited and adjusts its colouring accordingly.

The mode offers command completion, bracket matching and all the usual
widgets.

As Zap commands are not case sensitive, an option to allow for this has been
added, but trying to use the module without the case sensitivity turned on
causes it to highlight numerous innocent words which also happen to be Zap
commands.

The author has case sensitivity turned on.  Case sensitivity only applies to
those Zap commands which may easily be taken for normal English words.
Even with case sensitivity turned on, most commands are still recognised in
either case, but words like "IF" and "MODE" must be in upper case for them
to be coloured as Zap commands.  The author has edited his 'Keys' file so all
the Zap commands in it are in upper case.

The Keys file (or any other files with "KEY" in the first 256 bytes of the
text) is treated slightly differently from other files.  In particular,
Words starting on the first line are never coloured as keywords.

If the command list looks out of date, either file a bug report
(bugs@zap.uk.eu.org) or fix it yourself - the list is stored at the end of
the file, and you can add to it yourself without breaking things. Each entry
is of the form:

 [#]<command> [|,°,«,}]

where the # is optional, and means 'case sensitive' and the other characters
mean:

 | - normal
 ° - don't colour (but still complete, etc.)
 « - directive
 } - something to do with JRF scripting?

Note that, even if you edit your own copy, we'd rather you file a bug report
so we know about it too :-)

4.0 : Problems
==============
* The case sensitivity is a problem.
* In the Keys file, ( ... ) sequences containing TAB characters are not
  coloured.


5.0 : Early history
===================

v0.24 - (29-Nov-01)
      * TEXTURE_FLAGSTOGGLE added

v0.23 - (06-Jul-01)
      * Bugfix to Scripts loading code.

v0.22 - (30-Jun-2001) [cl]
      * Fix for bug causing data aborts in new files
      * Dummy command "Yum" no longer auto completes

v0.21 - (05-Nov-2000)
v0.20 - (08-May-2000)
v0.19 - (20-Mar-2000)
v0.18 - (28-Feb-2000)
v0.17 - (24-Nov-1999)
v0.16 - (28-Sep-1999)
v0.15 - (25-Jun-1997)
      * A number of new commands added.

v0.14 - (18-Apr-1997)
      * An RPC start-of-file bug fixed.
      * A number of new commands added.

v0.13 - (03-Apr-1997)
      * RUNSCRIPT and INSERT file commands added (and a few others).
      * Pressing escape at the same time as pressing '.' now always produces
        a '.' and never completes commands.

v0.12 - (28-Mar-1997)
      * Support of files of commands for Olly Betts' LineEditor added.
        This only really works well if the commands are all in upper case.
      * In 'Keys-like' files, numbers in the first column are not coloured.

v0.11 - (21-Mar-1997)
      * Syntax-colouring of Justin Fletcher's script files' directives.
      * A few new commands added.

v0.10 - (18-Mar-1997)
      * Now detects whether the file is a "Keys" file (by searching for
        "KEY" in the first 256 bytes of the file).  If so then ( ... )
        sequences are coloured, "|"s are ignored and the quote character is
        ignored if it is at the start of a line.  Any commands at the very
        beginnings of lines are not highlighted as they normally would be.
        If the keys file detection fails for some reason it is possible to
        control it manually from the mode menu.

v0.09 - (14-Mar-1997)
      * More commands added.
      * Beautify now works on the first character of names properly
        (introduced in v0.08).
      * 'FORZAP_FLAGSTOGGLE' command and buttons menu added.

v0.08 - (27-Feb-1997)
      * Added support for the latest version of ZapEmail.
      * Cured bugs relating to <...> sequences being coloured incorrectly
        when editing them.
      * Commands starting on the first character of the file are now coloured
        correctly.

v0.07 - (26-Feb-1997)
      * Buttons support added.

v0.06 - (23-Feb-1997)
      * Case sensitivity is now confined to problematical words - most
        command recognition is now case insensitive.
      * Many new commands added.
      * Delimiters of ( ... ) sequences are now coloured the same as their
        contents.

v0.05 - (21-Feb-1997)
      * The option to turn case sensitivity off was not working.
      * A few commands added.

v0.04 - (18-Feb-1997)
      * A " on the first character of a line (as may occur in the keys file)
        is now ignored.
      * Priorities of ( ... ) checking and command checking at line ends
        corrected.
      * Configuration saving routines should now work properly without
        interfering with other modes.

v0.03 - (17-Feb-1997)
      * A few commands added and the paths checked for corrected.

v0.02 - (13-Feb-1997) 
      * Added the option to turn case sensitivity off.

v0.01 - (12-Feb-1997) 
      * First released version.
