1.0 Features
============

Syntax colouring for Makefiles.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !MakeFile application into Zap's Modules directory.

Zap will then need to be restarted.


3.0 What it does
================

It syntax-colours make files.  make is a command line tool which originated
on unix systems to assist management of programming projects.

Make files do not really have a well-defined format across a range of
target platforms.


4.0 : Problems
==============

Mainly oriented around Acorn-style make files.

In particular there is not currently any support for the primitive foo.c or
foo/c naming conventions widely in use on other platforms.

Objects with '-' in them are always rendered as if they were switches.
