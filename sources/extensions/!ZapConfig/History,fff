information.

V1.40 (03 February 1999)	-- PUBLIC RELEASE

 * Fixed some template problems pointed out by Justin Fletcher.
 * Buffer size bug due to too small indirection buffer (JRF again).
   Ought to stop using fixed buffers, but that's a big problem
   because of the way the WIMP works ...

 V1.41
 ! Remaining bug(s?) with Justin's Keys file.
 * ic_? sprite - change into private one
 > Zap v1.41 !Config format
 > &322 startup command, opt_switches b31
 > Internationalisation support alongside Zap itself
 > Rebuild will hopefully get Global Replace right ...
 
 V1.42
 > Alternate keymap editing system
 > Single window configuration
 > ClickSend config
 > Font upgrading - write !ZapFonts.ZFMerge and use that?

 V1.43
 > Bind to Zap (makes + below unnecessary)

 > Cascading options styles (Tony Houghton) - how internally?
 + Buffer overflow checking - scanf() in opts!!! (use Zap's internally)
 + Paging system for Keys file long line loading
 + Other mode options
 + Finish colours
 + Font listing menus (or via ZapRedraw?)

V1.39 (9th November 1998)	-- PUBLIC RELEASE

 * Bugfix for keyboard handling (long-standing oops :-(

V1.38 (26th October 1998)	-- PUBLIC RELEASE

 * Support for Keyboard Extend autoload

V1.37 (1st July 1998)		-- PUBLIC ALPHA RELEASE

 * Format of &4xx variables was assumed, resulting in crashes sometimes.
   Thanks to Reuben Thomas for pointing this out.
 * MiscOps 18 (no horizontal scrollbar) supported.
 * Per-mode keymaps supported. Keymap names *should* already be in the
   format which Darren is using.
 * Fixed a long-standing bug in mode option handling which probably crept in
   around V1.26. For bored people, the menu handling code which switches
   which mode you're looking at wasn't storing all the options when it saved
   off the previous mode.

V1.36 (24th Mar 1998)		-- PUBLIC ALPHA RELEASE

 * Multi-segement ZapTemplates$Path copes with missing segments
 * Extensions scanned directly for modes, and list maintained
   during installing/deinstalling extensions
 * Minibuffer popup/permanent buttons work again (oops)

V1.35 (6th Mar 1998)		-- PUBLIC BETA RELEASE

 * Font window now functional again (oops)
 * Obsolete 'big endian' switch removed from display options
 * Configure external types
 * Copes with multi-segment ZapTemplates$Path

V1.34 (9th Feb 1998)		-- PUBLIC BETA RELEASE

 * Support for "block edit" option
 * Misc window close bug properly fixed - was using strlen(output+1)
   when I meant strlen(output)+1 ...

V1.33 (31st Jan 1997)		-- PUBLIC BETA RELEASE

 * Misc window close bug fixed
 * !ZapRun no longer gets additional blank line appended on each save
 * Misc window split; all windows now fit in 640x480
 * Delete a mode's options
 * Sanitise mode options

V1.32 (20th Dec 1997)		-- PUBLIC BETA RELEASE

 * Prevents editing mode options for a mode not in the Config file.
 * Settings variables &30e and &30f are now full commands rather than
   parameters.
 * Autoload ZapRedraw support removed.
 * "Be tolerant" (of broken Wimp messages) support.
 * Big endian per-mode configuration support.
 * Strong soft wrap support.

V1.31 (1st Dec 1997)

 * Support for autoload FlashCar.
 * Support for per-mode linewrap and wordwrap configuration. Also
   finally got right the exclusivity system for wrapping options.
   That said, the default for BASIC appears to disobey this ...
 * More conformant parent-child windows system.
 * Confirmation on quit is you might have modified something. This
   is a loose modified system; it assumes that if you've opened a
   window, you've changed something. Confirmation can be disabled
   by an option switch to ZapConfig.

V1.30 (1st Dec 1997)

 * Some code replication avoided. If nothing else, it makes the
   code more readable, and threw up a couple of minor bugs.
 * Config writing bug fixed. This would have been noticed with
   modes like Asm, OLE and Buttons. 3 (MOD 4) is my unlucky
   submodule ...
 * Rewrote some of the options handling. This fixed a
   long-standing memory leak, and discovered a couple of others.
   I also discovered that a listed "limitation" of the parser
   was in fact present in Zap as well, and so didn't count.
 * Above slightly reduced memory requirements and binary size.

V1.29 (24th Nov 1997)

 * All search defaults configurable
 * Settings variable &321 - minimum backup delay
 * Antialiased minibuffer text
 * Font offsets support removed
 * &30F, &30F variables are now "Mode filetype" and configurable as such.
 * Writeable icon order in Misc window made more sane.

V1.28 (20th Nov 1997)

 * Scans loaded Zap RMA for "Conf" if no <Zap$Options>.

V1.27 (19th Nov 1997)

 * atexit() handler added to make it all a bit more solid.
 * !Run checks for booted presence of ZapUser, and runs
   ZapUser:Config.!ZapRun if necessary to set Zap$Keys etc.
 * Error handling changed to do fatal / non-fatal properly.
 * Shift, control and page up/down "keys" work.

V1.26 (13th Nov 1997)		-- DEVELOPER RELEASE

 * 0x31f, 0x320 settings vars - quick print SOF, EOF
 * Autoload ZapRedraw, IClear support
 * Support for most of the latest global and mode-specific options
 * Support for v0.03 of the Zap directory structure
 * Re-open main window doesn't reset position

V1.25 (24th Aug 1997)		-- DEVELOPER RELEASE

 * New &3xx variables (&30C, &31D-31F).
 * Window display into windows and fonts.
 * Configuration of infinite wrap (miscop 8) and autoloads (miscops 9-12).
 * Tidied up some roughness to do with using ZapConfig:name instead of
   <Zap$name>. Also moved TypesHigh/TypesLow over to look in ZapUserConfig: as
   per the design for ZapUser.
 * Support for second Zap-handled mode word (wrapping, cursor confine, etc.)

V1.24 (24th May 1997)

 * Module management rewritten for new system.
 * File detection rewritten for new system.
 * Sorted out &500 variable handling.
 * Fixed mode handling code which tried to free the same pointer twice
   if it wasn't redefined in the meantime.

V1.23 (14th May 1997)		-- DEVELOPER RELEASE

 * Upgrader removed (since it should now be obsolete).
 * Module installer removed (obsoleted).
   The above two get rid of three of my largest source files (hooray!).
 * Zap 1.36 file structure.
 * File detection and module management disabled so I can get a working
   release out to developers.

V1.22 (3rd January 1997)

 * Tidied up some handling routines, and split a couple more source files.
 * Started work on cascading options sets. Main template is there, and currently
   leads only to the "tweak" screen, which is the old mode opts child.
 * Editing for minibuffer colours. Doesn't draw current colour, shortcuts don't
   work, and slider is non-functional.

V1.21 (18th December 1996)

 * Buffer space for Keys loading increased to 2k at request of Justin Fletcher.
 * Max option sets increased to 16 (max templates increased to 18).
 * Parent window stays open, and changes aren't saved until the main "Save"
   button is clicked. Opening a child window closes the currently open one.
 * Re-aligned iconbar menu.
 * Editing of Zap variable &31C, including FilerPatch suport.

V1.20 (26th September 1996)	-- FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE

 * Mode options editing (Zap-handled options only).
 * Decision on Menus: passes appropriate file for editing (okay, so it's a
   cop-out, but to be perfectly honest I doubt anyone would prefer to use a
   graphical editor over editing the file directly :-).
 * Distribution tidied for release, and helpfile updated.

V1.19 (25th September 1996)

 * Menu bugs introduced when I moved over to DeskLib fixed.
 * Keymap editing.
 * Miscellaneous other bug fixes.

V1.18 (24th September 1996)

 * Minor bug fixes and tidying up bits of code and supporting files.
 * (Config) installer plus example files.
 * Can now change the Zap base mode (Misc. window).
 * Installer/module manager/upgrader front end.
 * Added caseless matching for installer so filename case can be preserved.
 * Fudged Config loading to deal with apparently illegal ones that Zap produces
   sometimes (skips garbage data between legal segments). Also fixed a major
   bug (which didn't cause problems for Zap, just for ZapConfig).

V1.17 (20th September 1996)

 * Bug fixes in installer, and extended fragment analyser to cope with Daniel
   Wagenaar's and Elliott Hughes' modules.
 * Background code reorganisations.
 * Change options and templates set used by Zap.

V1.16 (19th September 1996)

 * Various bug fixes.
 * Still got a problem with the sprite in the filetype opts window. Dunno
   why.
 * Fixed minor bug in keys parsing which crept in when I started using
   strtol() instead of OS_ReadUnsigned.
 * Zap installer - modules and directory autoinstall.

V1.15 (17th September 1996)

 * Fixed -prerpc switch implementation in !Run file.
 * Fixed wrap width being cleared on closing Display window.
 * Fixed bug with null entries in Keys file (I think).
 * Added "Trap MSDOS files" support.
 * Filetype recognition code added (variables &5xx and &1000-&2000).
 * Moved entirely over to DeskLib.
 * Dropped CLibrary usage.

### V1.14 lost due to harddisc crash :-( ###

V1.13 (6th June 1996)		-- FIRST RELEASE to D.Symes, M.Wilcox and others

 * Editing of !Config file.
 * Miscellaneous doesn't yet support either MS-DOS trapping (because it isn't
   documented), or minibuffer colours.

V1.12 (3rd June 1996)

 * Added pre-RPC keyboard layout support, selected by !RunImage -prerpc.

V1.11 (3rd June 1996)

 * Memory leakage traced to slightly stupid assumption on my part that
   Wimp_LoadTemplate requires no scratch space in addition to the actual
   window definition size.

V1.10 (27th May 1996)

 * Editing of all misc., display and main keymap options from Keys file.
 * Allows editing of different options sets, and creating new ones.
