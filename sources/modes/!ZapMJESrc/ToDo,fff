Things we need to do with ZapMJE
================================

 * make preprocessor optional in Java mode (s.C_Redraw.checkpreproc$L:674)
   (James has made a build-time option of this, but there's no support in
   the makefile as yet; we want it dynamic so we can clone to a JavaPP mode
   or similar)
 * rewrite indenting code
 * rewrite or at least tidy up word move code
 * function browser speaking modern Throwback
 * builds under everything, and properly with it
   (Seems to build fine under both the MakeMJE obey taskwindow system and
   just typing 'amu' in the top level. AS currently untested.)
