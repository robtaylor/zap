Description
===========

There's not much to this module really, it does one job and does it well. All
it does is remove the mouse pointer whenever you type a character, and
replace it again whenever you move or click with the mouse.

This module was written after there was something similar on an Acorn User
disk. I'd been wanting something like this for ages, and then when the Acorn
User one turned up I was really happy. Until I started using it. I found
something in the region of a dozen problems with it, some very annoying as
well. (Such as removing the pointer even if you just press the shift key,
great for shift double-clicking, not; switching the pointer back on even when
it shouldn't be, in games and the command line; getting confused with the
hourglass; etc.) This then spurred me on to write this one, which not only
fixed all the problems, but also reduced the size by over 30% too. :-)


To use it just double click on it and forget it. It only takes just over ½k
of memory so is excellent value.

Version 0.20 of this module has been hacked into a 32 bit compatible version
by the Zap Developers.

(i) You do not modify either the module nor the help file in any way, nor
separate them.

(ii) You do not make any money out of it.

If you want to do one of the above then contact me and ask. I probably don't
mind.

otherwise for any particular task. If it does anything nasty then I want to
know so I can fix it, but I'm not taking any responsibility. (Besides,
there's no point in sueing me since I've got no money.)
