FlashCar causes the caret to blink, with configurable on and off periods.
It operates as a module task, is ROMmable and the module takes up 985 bytes.

This version of FlashCar is distributed as Freeware. It comes with no
warranty. It is also distributed with Zap (v1.40 and later).


Usage
˜˜˜˜˜

Double-click on the module to install it.  To change the on/off periods (both
are 30/100ths sec. by default), set the variables FlashCar$On and
FlashCar$Off to appropriate values.


Why we wrote it
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

Having a flashing caret is extremely useful; Acorn should have built this
feature in. There seemed to be no standalone utility that's compatible with
the newest Acorns that did this job and no other (in the past it's often been
provided with "do-it-all" utilities such as Menon, or with pointless extras,
such as the Flasher application that comes with Risc PCs).

Reuben took Flasher apart to find out how it worked and wrote a small
machine-code version, which takes less processor time and memory. Tim
converted it to a module to improve resource consumption further.
