; version		ZapUtil release version number. Format is "n.nn ".
; version_major		major part of the release version number
; version_minor		minor part of the release version number

; patch_level		for release versions, this is the patch level;
;			for test versions, this is the test release number
; test_flag		{TRUE} if this is a test version

; Set test_flag for alpha and beta versions.
; Set patch_level for patches on major releases.

; Settings:
;   test_flag	patch_level	Version number displayed
;   ={FALSE}	=""		n.nn (date)
;   ={FALSE}	<>""		n.nn (date) patch-l
;   ={TRUE}	=""		n.nn (date) [TEST]
;   ={TRUE}	<>""		n.nn (date) [TEST l]
; where 'n.nn ' represents the release version number, and
;           'l' represents the patch level.

; If BUILD != "", then it overrides test_flag and patch_level, eg.
;   BUILD	Version number displayed
;   "foo"	n.nn (date) foo-l
;   "foo-42"	n.nn (date) foo-42
; (for various values of foo and 42).

; See the Zap makefile for details of how to set BUILD.
; DO *NOT* SET BUILD HERE!
