Here are four font utility programs:

bdf->Zap
~~~~~~~~
The program bdf->Zap by Martin Ebourne will convert bdf fonts to Zap format.
This program has its own help file, 'bdfHelp'.

FontUtils
~~~~~~~~~
FontUtils (by Alexander Thoukydides) is designed to assist with the process
of generating font sub-styles from a base font.  It comes with a supplied
example, 'FontUtilEg' which illustrates a number of its possible uses.

ZaptoSpr (ConvrtFont)
~~~~~~~~
This utility will convert between Zap's own format and sprite files so that
the fonts can be edited.

PixelFont
~~~~~~~~~
PixelFont is a utility for generating RISC-OS outline fonts from 16 colour
greyscale bitmaps.  These do not strictly have much to do with !ZapFonts,
but can produce a very pleasing result when used in Zap.  Thanks to
Richard Atterer for giving his permission to include his utility here.

All the programs are quite primitive tools, although the first three have
WIMP front ends.
