This directory contains different template sets for Zap. To change templates
you should edit the ZapUser:Config.!ZapRun file directly.

If you would like to design your own template sets, please see the file
Docs.Boxes which describes the required specifics of each template. Also
look at current sets, and at how Zap uses them in practice. If you would
like your templates distributed with future versions of Zap, please get in
touch with one of the developers (see the manual for contact details).
