1.0 Features
============

Syntax colouring for LaTeX files with some support for TeX.

Command completion for many LaTeX command macros.

2.0 Installation
================

Copy the module "ZapTeX" into an appropriately-named subdirectory of the
"3rdParty" directory inside the Zap application.

In the file called "External", in the directory "!Zap.Options.Default" or 
wherever the variable Zap$External points to, add lines as follows:

<Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!ZapTeX.ZapTeX Obey <Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!ZapTeX.!Setup
	TeX
	-
	LATEX_FLAGSTOGGLE		&8017
	LATEX_QUOTE			&0
	LATEX_ENVIRONMENT		&58
	LATEX_NEXTCHAPTER		&0
	LATEX_NEXTSECTION		&0
	LATEX_NEXTSUBSECTION		&0
	LATEX_PREVCHAPTER		&0
	LATEX_PREVSECTION		&0
	LATEX_PREVSUBSECTION		&0
	-

This tells Zap about the new mode.  To get the relevant files loaded by
default into the mode then you will need to edit the "Keys" file.

My keys file has these lines in it:

Paths:
...
&500	&FFF	\#\*.tex.\#\*		+TeX
&500	&FFF	\#\*.tex		+TeX
&500	&FFF	\#\*.aux		+TeX
...

File types:
...
LaTeX		&12A8	TeX
TeX		&12A7	TeX


3.0 What it does and does not do
================================

It syntax-colours LaTeX files.

It has a (long) list of LaTeX and TeX commands which it recognises,
and colours appropriately, but because of the massive scope of the language
it will not always get things right.  If this irritates you then you can set
'recognised command' colour and the 'unrecognised command' to be the same
as one another.

Command completion is available.  The leading '\' and the first (few)
letter(s) of a command may be typed and then '.' pressed.  For example
'\section' may be entered as '\s.'

There is currently a special colour reserved for commands with @s in them.
This is of little relevance in LaTeX itself, but can help when viewing files
in related formats.

There are a number of commands originally written by Elliot Hughes' for his
LaTeX mode.


4.0 : Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* \@ is not currently coloured correctly.
* The $ ... $ bracket matching works poorly - it doesn't work back to the
  start of the line to see if there have been an even number of $ and $$
  constructs.
* It pays no attention to '\begin{verbatim} ... \end{verbatim}'-like
  structures and gaily carries on colouring the contents of these as though
  they were still LaTeX.


5.0 : History
-------------

v0.04 - (11-Nov-1997)
      * Revamped for the latest version of Zap.
v0.03 - (04-Aug-1997)
      * Elliot Hughes' LaTeX commands added to ZapTeX.  Many thanks are
        due to Elliot for supplying his module's source code.
      * An old problem with things like \\\tt resolved.
      * Old 'Beautify' code stripped out.
v0.02 - (23-Jun-1997)
      * Added support for ZapSpell.  Words prefixed by "\", "$", "@" or "{"
        which are not being escaped by a "\" are not queried as spelling
        mistakes.
v0.01 - (15-Jun-1997)
      * First version private release only.

Enjoy
