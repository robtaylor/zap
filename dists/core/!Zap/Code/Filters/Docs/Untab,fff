 Untab - Version 1.00 © Stephen Revill, 7th April 1998
-=====================================================-

This little program simply replaces each tab character in a file with an
equivilent number of spaces, thus untabbing the file (useful if you decide
that you didn't want to tabify a file at some earlier point).

At this point, the program takes no parameters.
