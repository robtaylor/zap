Beyond v1.40
============

Brief note to everyone
*--------------------*

Hi. This probably isn't useful to anyone other than me, especially now we
have a proper bug and wish list. *This* is a list of:

a)	notes about release schedules
b)	bugs in the development version of Zap. These are only when not noted in the
	main buglist for some reason. (Typically they're transient bugs in my own
	development work.)
c)	things I'm working on. This is more for my own notes on where I've got to. If
	you're looking for what I'm planning to do, check which items in the wishlist
	and/or buglist I've claimed responsibility for. (And you can ask to take them
	off me if you want to :-)
d)	things I want to do to extensions, in no order at all.
e)	other things

Release schedules:
------------------

	- v1.45. In the future. I've given up even trying ... :-(

Bugs with v1.44:
----------------

Documentation:
--------------

Distribution:
-------------

Core:
-----

(now in some sort of order)

None of this will be looked at until v1.45 lands in a reasonably stable fashion.

  investigate:
  	+ double/triple/etc dragging. a) backwards works from end of word (currently start).
  	  b) doesn't select until you've hit the end of the word (this is correct when going
  	  backwards, not so useful going forwards). Same problems with triple (line) selection.
  	- throwback affects older view on a file, not most recent / where search started
  	- SENDSEL and CRs problem
  	- menu building with double instantiation of a command that has a leaf dbox crashes.
  	  However separate commands on the same dbox don't (TotalSel, WCSel)
  	- the multicommand with WIMPTASK in it from menu bug ...
  	- multicommand blocks in variable &30E, &30F, &322 cause general bad things.
  	  Iconbar state problems?
  
  think about:
  	- stopping "out of memory" from looping
  	- changing early module offsets screws redraw ... more generally, redraw isn't
  	  forced for changing one entry in the module table ... could probably get this
  	  somehow by trapping redraw part of the module header -> redraw all of the
  	  module header, but this is rather messy. Better solution: add a service call
  	  "file has been edited between <here> and <here>" and use that. This will work
  	  with per-mode transient data, also - allowing redraw state caching. (Should
  	  speed up Code mode, probably C et al; and allow more sophisticated modes to
  	  be written sanely.)
  	- colouring in Code mode; colouring options in Code mode; probably need another
  	  word mode ...
  	+ Fonts: error when default font file is completely missing; should probably
  	  set font system to System font or something.
  	+ escape from permanent minibuffer could return cursor to window? Actually - whenever
  	  the minibuffer would normally have been closed, return the focus.
  	+ strip spaces and modified (cf: DOS file and Spool file)

  probably fairly soon post-v1.45:
	+ a generic Autoload directory (or path? - ZapUser:Autoload)
	  (RepeatPath?)

  in progress:
	- TMFs
		- per-file variable overrides (setvar) - export as Zap_ call too
		  (do we allow interpolation? ideally, yes ... would be nice to
		   have % as a special mode name meaning 'in this file'?)
		  This may be tricky to do ...
		- Core uses c-vars for soft wrap chars etc.
		- variable substitution (exported throughout Zap independently -- check
		  the substitution code used in the FILTER* commands in ZapText)
		- dumpvars command? Same for mode?

  things that look fun and/or incredibly useful:
	- keypresses on a hotkey window
	- commands in file header

  v1.50 things I've started thinking about:
  	- list of files window. Want several 'file groups', perhaps 32.
  	  Icons to flip between them, options to hide the icons. Colours
  	  for the groups? FILEGROUP (=1,2) or (+3) or (-3) and
  	  @FILEINGROUP (3) or @FILEINGROUP (3, 2) (OR? or not allow
  	  multiple arguments?).
  	  Augment search, ALLWINDOWS, etc. to work within groups.
  	- Buttons done centrally ... notes: call on e_start, for kicks to
	  sort everything out. Call on e_openwindow ... note that
	  e_openwindow can be called without e_start being called on that
	  window ... do something about this (possibly just call e_start).
	  Extend Buttons_Misc #3 flags so we can lie things inside the
	  borders. Probably need to add redraw top and bottom margins to get
	  this really swish ... and have all margins configurable per-mode.
	  Ideally do all Buttons configuration via TMFs, except for the
	  positions flags.
	  Call Buttons_Misc #7 (flush redraw cache) automatically on
	  changing the wrap type; don't assume the mode will do it.
	  Tell Buttons when windows close (gets rid of a fudge) ... probably
	  need to ask Tim about this, unless he's commented interally.
	  Similarly, input focus location needs to be called into, I think.
	  See Tim's emails, and check the Buttons source.
	  Why does Buttons currently have its own mode? Kill that off.
	  Extend formats to give interactive help on the buttons. (cf: Menus)
	  (Note that this may be partly implemented - the bottleneck may be
	  in Zap's core ...)
	  Add an e_init or similar flag to say "never do my buttons for me",
	  to allow modes to do sophisticated button stuff.
	  Take out all Buttons code from all modes, unless they need it to do
	  something swish.

  other stuff:
	- close modified -> SaveCBox/SaveOBox => doesn't close save box/window
	  To do this, change save_to_file (called from save_from_leaf/send_data_save),
	  save_text (NOTE: exported; API change!), save_file_date to take r7=0
	  => no leaf window caller, else xfer kill state flag (b3 of r7's flags word)
	  to new window when we create it. This *should* solve things. However it's
	  an API change because of save_text, so I don't want to do it until v1.46.

  bugs where the Log isn't looking big and scary enough yet:
  	- Learned sequences which involve a search dbox corrupt the search string?
  	  I don't think this is easily soluble ... there's no way of passing the search
  	  string back in. Admittedly it probably shouldn't corrupt the saved search string,
  	  but I doubt this is a particularly important area. i-search seems to work fine,
  	  after all ...
  	- two cursors 'sometimes' visible in i-search? Seems to me that they're *always*
  	  visible, and that this is a good thing ... ah, I see. The 'mark' cursor is
  	  left at the abort position, but doesn't get redrawn properly - probably just
  	  want to force a redraw of that.
  	  Looks like it's something within the bowels of goto_file_offset ... which I
  	  don't understand at the moment.

  pre-3.5 issues which I'm dropping, since this is no longer a supported platform
  (in any case, most of these issues were due to the way the whole memory system works,
  rather than bugs as such):
  	- app to app xfer seems to claim twice as much memory as Filer -> Zap? RAM xfer
  	  might leak?
	    -- I can't reproduce this on a 3.1 machine
  	- running out of memory during an insert op leaks memory; is the UNDO op stuff not
  	  being freed? With Dynamic Areas, it may data abort or similar ... ?
  	- out of memory while loading a file doesn't free up the WimpSlot (but does minimise
  	  memory subsequently free things up - ie is it simply that Zap won't auto-shrink its
  	  memory?)
  	- apparently complains about lack of memory when there's clearly enough (in mode 13?)
	    -- I can't reproduce this on a 3.1 machine (unsurprisingly)
