        ZapMsg - A syntax colouring mode for Messages files
        ===================================================

Features
--------

This module provides syntax colouring for Messages files. These are files
used by RISC OS to provide support for internationalisation.

It colours GSTrans sequences like <Obey$Dir>, |G and <255>.

It also supports Zap spell and avoids quering users about the spelling of
tokens, and is intelligently aware that words starting with "|M", "%s", "\S"
and, (by convention) "`z" actually start with the letter following this
sequence.


Installation 
------------

Copy the !Messages application into the Zap.Modules directory, then reload Zap.
