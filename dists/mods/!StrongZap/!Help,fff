	       StrongZap, a Zap syntax colouring mode
	       ======================================

1.0 Features
============

Here is StrongZap, a !Zap syntax colouring mode for StrongHelp files.

As well as the syntax colouring this mode has a button bar which facilitates
the process of creating hyperlinks.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no claim that it is bug free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all the
files remain intact.

2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !StrongZap application into the !Zap.Modules directory, then restart Zap.


3.0 Features
============

Command
~~~~~~~
FORZAP_FLAGSTOGGLE <word>

This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them. This is used internally to generate
the mode menu.


4.0 Problems
============

So far the shortcomings are that "#"s and ";"s after "#"s are not
coloured in a particularly pleasing manner.  There are also a large
number of idiosyncrasies with the colouring of any subsequent commands.

There is a need for more logical colours, in this mode which I hope to
address at some point.  A number of logical colours currently play
multiple roles.

The mode is sensitive to the last character of the file being a line
feed, and will not colour commands on the last line correctly if this is
not present.  This is common in some existing StrongHelp files.
