LATEX_ENVIRONMENT <string> (Elliott Hughes)
This command allows you to insert an environment into your document with the
minimum of typing. If it's executed without a string argument, it opens the
minibuffer so that you can enter an environment name. Once it has a string,
it inserts the text:
†
\begin{<string>}
[]
\end{<string>}
†
where [] represents the final position of the caret.

LATEX_FLAGSTOGGLE <word> (Tim Tyler)
This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.

LATEX_NEXTCHAPTER (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the next chapter.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_NEXTSECTION (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the next section.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_NEXTSUBSECTION (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the next subsection.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_PREVCHAPTER (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the previous chapter.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_PREVSECTION (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the previous section.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_PREVSUBSECTION (Elliott Hughes)
Moves the caret to the the start of the previous subsection.
This can be of use for quickly skipping through a large LaTeX document.

LATEX_QUOTE (Elliott Hughes)
This command tries to insert the êcorrectë LaTeX-style quotes at the cursor.
As you know, the quote character isn't much used by TeXperts.  This command
can be bound to the quote key in an alternative keymap and will do its best
to type what you meant to type.  If the character before the cursor is
whitespace or an opening brace, `` will be inserted.  If the character is a
backslash, an ordinary quote will be inserted instead.  Otherwise, '' is
inserted.
