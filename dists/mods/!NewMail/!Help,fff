             ZapNewMail, a Zap syntax colouring mode
             =======================================

1.0 Features
============

Here is ZapNewMail, a Zap syntax colouring mode for dealing with mail.

I feel a bit like I am stepping on Darren Salt's territory here, so
apologies to him, and here's hoping I keep him on his toes.

This mode was written because some aspects of Darren's mode did not suit
me.  In particular I had difficulties in viewing mail files containing
more than one message.  Darren's mode has improved in this respect since this
mode was written.  Darren's mode is superior for editing mail in, and due
the the flexibility allowed by Zap regarding the ways of choosing which
files are edited in which mode, it is normally possible to allow OLE files
from most mail/news program to be edited by Darren's mode while sending raw
SMTP files directly to ZapNewMail.

My mode has a different style of syntax-colouring from Darren's.  It has not
been the intention to duplicate the functionality of Darren's editing
features, but rather to provide an alternative mail viewing environment.
Note that some of the commands provided by Darren's module will work even if
his mode is not currently displaying the file.

The module contains some enhancements to the cursor keys so that when
they are used in combination with the shift key they behave in a more
appropriate manner than when is in text mode.  These routines have been
stolen from Martin Ebourne's C mode and are documented by him in his own
directory.  Basically they make the shift-cursor combinations pause more
frequently and more intelligently step through the code.  Martin has
kindly given me his permission to use his code.

Although the author welcomes correspondence concerning this mode, he
makes no claim that it is bug free and, it is not guaranteed to perform
any particular function.  It is to be used entirely at one's own risk.

This is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all the
files remain intact.

2.0 Installation
================

Copy the module "ZapNewMail" into an appropriately-named subdirectory of
the "3rdParty" directory inside the !Zap application.

In the file called "External", in the directory "!Zap.Options.Default" or
wherever the variable Zap$External points to, add lines as follows:

<Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!NewMail.ZapNewMail Obey <Zap$3rdParty>.Tyler.!NewMail.!Setup
        NewMail
	-
	NEWMAIL_FLAGSTOGGLE		&8017
	NEWMAIL_LISTSENDERS		&1
	-

...and a line like:

MailFT		&1xxx   NewMail

...for whatever filetype you use for mail messages.

Zap will then need to be restarted.

Lines designed to load files from the 'OLEfiles' directory (or similar) will
normally be needed if you would like to edit mail and news in the mode as
well as viewing them.  However, using Darren Salt's ZapEmail mode is
recommended for doing this.

Commands
~~~~~~~~
NEWMAIL_FLAGSTOGGLE <word>

This has the same syntax as the WFORMAT_TOGGLE command.  It ticks menu
entries if it is attached to them.

NEWMAIL_LISTSENDERS

This lists all the lines in the mail file starting with the text "From: "
in a throwback buffer.

3.0 History
===========

v1.12 - (29-Sep-99)
      * Removed the bit which sends URLs on ctrl/alt+click. Partly because
        rewriting now that SENDURLGIVENOFFSET has (sensibly) been ditched was
        a hassle, but mostly because ClickSend does this happily on alt+double
        click, which is more consistent. The code is still there, just never
        called.

v1.11 - (15-Apr-97)
      * Added LISTFNS and NEWMAIL_LISTSENDERS commands, and their associated
	buttons.

v1.10 - (23-Mar-97)
      * Added support for 'Window Wrap' and Buttons.
      * Darren Salt's Alt/Ctrl - double-click protocol supported (this
        depends for its action on ZapDS v0.29).
      * Large numbers of improvements to the wrapping of text across line
        ends.

v1.09 - (24-Feb-97)
      * Added support for ZapButtons.  Note that some applications (instead
        of using OLE) have been know to rely on the editor's window being at
        the top of the window stack and perform their file transfer when
        this was no longer the case.  ZapButtons' panes of tools will almost
        certainly confuse this primitive mechanism; simplest to turn the
        buttons off if there are problems.

v1.08 - (12-Jan-97)
      * Cured RPC specific problem with starting from blank files in
        ZapNewMail.

v1.07 - (06-Jan-97)
      * The Zap command "OLEFILECHANGED" was added in error and then
        quickly stripped out again (apologies).

v1.06 - (09-Dec-96)
      * Logical line numbering bugs fixed.

v1.05 - (05-Dec-96)
      * A couple more start of line markers added.

v1.04 - (19-Nov-96)
      * Fix for bug involving lines containing things like "from:" and
        "to:" from messing up the colouring on the next line.

v1.03 - (10-Nov-96)
      * Fix for RPC owners who use !Zap with dynamic areas: a problem
        sometimes occurred when SHIFT left-arrow was pressed at the
        start of a file, or SHIFT right-arrow at the end of one.  I
        have applied the solution to this problem to all my modes.

v1.02 - (05-Nov-96)
      * Bug involving "&" and ";" characters (left over from my ZapHotMeal
        module) removed.
      * Massive internal changes to fix problems at end of lines.
      * "X-" prefixed strings are now always coloured as commands.

v1.01 - (02-Nov-96)
      * First release on the web.

v1.00 - (30-Nov-96)
      * Very early release as a RFC to Dom Symes.
