Dominic Symes, the primary author of Zap works at ARM Ltd.  He originally
developed the program and was its sole maintainer until the end of 1996.

Please note that Zap is nothing to do with ARM.

The program is now being maintained by a group of `Zap developers'.

Principally, these are Tim Tyler, Darren Salt and James Aylett.
