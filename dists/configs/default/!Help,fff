!ZapUser version 1.45 (29-Sep-99)
=================================

!ZapUser is home to the user settings for !Zap. These are, currently:

	Country		Configures Zap's country-specific features
	ClickSend	Configuration for alt-double-clicks
	Settings	Miscellaneous configuration
	TypesHigh	High priority file type recognition
	TypesLow	Low priority file type recognition
	!Config		Global and per-mode configuration
	!ZapBoot	User-controllable Zap boot script
	!ZapRun		User-controllable Zap run script

Directories:

	Keys		Key map configuration
	Menus		Menu definitions
	TMFs		c-var settings for modes (these may override
			those supplied with the modes themselves)

!ZapUser is intended to be used with Zap 1.36a or later. To use it, either
boot it before you run Zap (in which case Zap will use the options set
contained in !ZapUser), or double-click on !ZapUser and then get Zap to
reload its settings (Reload keys from the Options menu, or the Zap command
ReloadKeys) to change options set. (Note that this won't update the menus -
you need to re-run Zap for that.)

It is advised that you put !ZapUser in Boot:Choices in a RiscPC boot
structure, or somewhere in your own boot sequence where it will be booted
before Zap runs.
