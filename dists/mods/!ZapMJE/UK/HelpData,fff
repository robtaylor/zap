If the string is "@" then the cursor is put into the header file referred
to in the file on the same line as the cursor.
The header files are loaded if necessary.
Library header files in the current project are searched first, followed by
those in the library (which is presumed to be on the "C:" path).
Text of the form 'h.foo' and 'foo.h' are both acceptable references.
There is not yet any support for paths of the form 'Hdr.foo' or 'foo/h'.
