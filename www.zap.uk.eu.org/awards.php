<h1>Awards</h1>

<p>Along the way, Zap has picked up a few awards. These are the ones we can remember.</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <h3>Netscape Open Directory Cool Site</h3>

  <a href="http://dmoz.org/"><img src="img/nsn_cool1.gif" width=140 height=45
          border=0 align=right alt="Cool Site"></a>
  <P>We appear to have be listed as a Cool Site in their <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Operating_Systems/RISCOS/Software/Programming/">RISC OS programming section</a>. I don't really know what this means (other than the fact that we get a little star by the entry in the Open Directory); the entire thing appears to be a bit like Yahoo, only moderated by the general public (so it proves that at least one person thinks Zap is cool :-).</p>
  <br clear=all>
 </li>

 <li>
  <h3><a href="http://www.heyrick.co.uk/frobnicate/">Frobnicate</A> highest-rated PD/Free/Shareware package</h3>

  <p>I'd love to be able to say more about this, but the magazine is distributed as an Ovation document, and the demo version doesn't like actually displaying the text :-(</p>
 </li>

 <li>
  <h3>ANS Awards '99</h3>

  <p>Zap came first in both the PD and Utilities categories, apparently.</p>
 </li>

</ul>
