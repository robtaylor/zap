Beyond v1.40
============

(Old ToDo list follows at end of file.)

Brief note to everyone
*--------------------*

Hi. This is a list of:

a)	bugs in the release version of Zap that I know about. If you have found a bug
	that's not here, tell me about it.
b)	bugs in the development version of Zap. These will pop up and down faster than
	I can keep track of them, but I'll try to keep things vaguely up to date (if
	only for my own use). Some reports in here may be a little cryptic as a result.
c)	things I want to do to the core of Zap, in some form of order. This allows
	people to avoid suggesting things I already want to do, complain bitterly about
	the things I want to do, steal what I want to do and do it themselves if it
	looks like that will be faster, and generally know what I'm doing without my
	having to tell everyone about it explicitly.
d)	things I want to do to extensions, in no order at all.
e)	crazy things I'd like, but probably will migrate completely to linux before
	completing (or possibly even starting).
f)	other things.

Bugs outstanding on v1.40:
--------------------------
	- with a long (> width) last line, selecting by dragging a selection downwards:
		a) after a triple-click, doesn't select any of the last logical line
		b) dragging down 'off' the LHS doesn't select any of the last physical line
	  (Tim)
	- BASIC colours 'lr' in lr% as a register in assembler (Reuben)
	- (more a misfeature) throwback moves oldest view on a file, not
	  most recent / one that search was started in (Theo)
	- crash on shift-end? (Chris Bell)
	- RAM transfer from Zap to Impression? "Directory [rubbish] not found" (Chris Bell)
	- sort out problem associated with ZapGenerated: on a read-only file
	  system (ie: make sure it never is!). Solution (?): use <Wimp$ScrapDir>.Zap. for
	  ZapGenerated$Path . (Chris Bell)
	- BASIC mode: undo falls over sometimes
	- BASIC mode: cursor disappears sometimes?
	- DWExt: incorrectly still refers to !Zap.3rdParty somewhere?
	- double/triple/etc-click dragging - moving backwards selects from
	  start of word/line/etc., not end. Can this easily be altered?
	  Also: new word/line/etc. should be selected as soon as mouse hits start of
	  unit, not end.
	  (Joe Oldak)
	- Ursula crash for QUICKSAVE et al (save_text) with no path (data abort - is
	  r2 getting corrupted on return to Wimp_Poll area?) (Neil)
	- close modified -> save -> "older than on disc"; save box remains,
	  window doesn't close (SOMETIMES)

Bugs with v1.41:
----------------
	- byte/word/code modes don't RETURN et al properly
	- startup command?

Documentation:
--------------
	- it'd be nice to output all the docs as StrongHelp ... then the tech docs
	  could go under the same source system as the manual. Feasible in theory, but
	  requires some thought, and a fair amount of hacking of Simon's horrible
	  code :-)
	- similarly, it'd be nice to get rid of the horrible RULEHERE hack I'm using
	  throughout the manual ...

Core:
-----

(now in some sort of order)

  the irritating one that I'll do as soon as I have the patience:
	- bit fields use symbols not constants (merely source tidying)

  little things I'll do first:
	- some sort of link to the manual from iconbar menu / Info window
	- typing replaces selection?
	- stopop if necessary on mouse click in window (Cursors:mouse_click
	  before e_click call? - after FNSTR R11,key_lastcom)
	- alt+shift over selection -> selection menu?
	  switch to invert behaviour (no modifiers -> selection menu)?
	  *** if so, re-arrange reserved menu space: 0-9 'special', 10-19
	  'internal mode', 20+ unreserved ***
	  Use Cursors:testifinsideselection
	- &3xx variable to specify default mode

  slightly bigger things that look fun and/or incredibly useful:
	- throwback sets file title to something useful (internal, plus
	  Message_ThrowbackStart -> Message_TaskNameRq)
	- TMFs (and set per-file temporarily; setvar command)
	- keypresses on a hotkey window
	- 'tie' two windows together? (or more windows ...)
	- commands in file header
  
  things I may leave to Darren / anyone else (if not, I'll look at them post v1.45):
	- indent/outdent performable on a single line
	- mode info block (replace e_interrogate #14)
	- support for modes to multiply instantiate (see ZapSEd) - mode cloning
	- some way of including menu help text in the menu definitions
	- configurable print headers and footers

  some other things which I'll do 'eventually' (probably post v1.50):
	- NewFile: fix cursor positioning bug
	- Revert
	- longer search macros
	- shortcuts (ie: expanding abbreviations) - only don't put it in the core

  other things, either unlikely to get done, or fairly heavyweight:
	- narrowing
	- redefine keystrokes in dialogue boxes (idea from StrongED - probably don't bother)
	- folding

  things currently being done by others:
	- MessageTrans-ify (internationalisation) - DS work in progress
	  (Remember to have ZapGenerated:Messages being rebuilt automatically.
	   Possibly ZapGenerated:<locale>.*? - internationalised Templates.)

Extensions:
-----------

ZapConfig
	- v1.41 config format
ZapText	- SwapCase is nice to tokenised modes
	- Messages
ZapUtil	- setname uses TMFs
	- Messages
ZapProg	- AssembleADRL/X
	- DataAdd et al
	- SWIToName, SWIToNumber
	- header/function/TLD finding (liaise with Tim, check out DWExt)
	- new MAKE/CC etc. commands using TMFs
ZapSEd	- parsing StrongED mode files (plus extensions?) - see core
ZapSGML	- colours based on supplied DTD

Other things:
-------------

RCS/CVS for Risc OS, and support within Zap

Probably drop:
--------------

Larch, ZapTerm (=> ssh for Risc OS), ZapW3
Other IDE functions / external tie-in IDE (source browser / makefile management)?

















Things to do
============

									Notes
Core:
-----
e_returnword
	- DELETE "WORD", DELWORDSTART|END	Day ?			Necessary?	?
	  (delete whitespace around also)			-- not binary modes
source
	- All bit field things should use symbols not constants
Newfile
	- Fix cursor positioning bug?
Revert
	- Tie down details?

ZapBASIC:
---------
	- basic_returnword						TMT
	- basic_help							TMT

Command extensions:
-------------------

ZapText
	- SwapCase is nice to BASIC					TMT
ZapProgram
	- New MAKE/CC/etc. commands
	- ??? header/function/TLD finding
	- AssembleADRL/X
	- DataAdd
	- SWIToName, SWIToNumber

v1.50 alterations:
------------------
TMFs
	- setname: param, or if "" search for in-core.
	  This should be configurable by a variable, using
	  InCoreName-Start and InCoreName-End or similar.
	  Also InCoreName-Translate (to-dir-format, maintain-extension,
	  nil).
Mode info block (e_interrogate #14 replacement)
Folding

Internet things:
----------------
ZapSGML
ZapMailer (Larch)
ZapTerm (=> ssh for Risc OS)
ZapW3

Other:
------
CVS for Risc OS
RCS support internal to Zap (or external using a service call?)
Other IDE functions? Source browsing, etc.?				Necessary?
