1.0 Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
True syntax colouring for Texture Garden files and support for textures from
Studio24Pro and PhotoDesk 2.

Command completion and bracket matching have now been implemented.

Command completion is activated as normal by typing in the first part
of a command and then pressing the full-stop key (".").

There is "Beautify" option which forces the displayed case of recognised
commands to a pattern that enhances the readability of texture files.

Cursor key enhancements stolen from Martin Ebourne's modes (see later).

If you have a copy of Studio24Pro then this module works with textures from
that program as well.  It keeps its textures in a "Textures" directory too.
The "Beautify" option is useful for Studio24Pro texture files.  Textures
from PhotoDesk are also offered similar support.


2.0 Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy the !Texture application directory inside !Zap.Modules, then restart Zap.

3.0 What it does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the module does not know about a command it colours it differently from
normal commands to indicate that it has not been recognised.  This enables
the module to be used as a spell-checker and, to a limited extent, a syntax
checker.  The rule, as with most zap modes, is that if it is coloured
incorrectly, then it needs examining.  If it is coloured it as though it is
right, this does not mean it will actually work.

Command completion has now been implemented.  Note that the full-stop
abbreviations used by ZapTexture and those implemented by Texture Garden
are not guaranteed to be the same.  E.g. "o." might expand to something
different in ZapTexture than what it would be treated as if it was fed
as an abbreviation directly to Texture Garden.  Users are now unlikely
to be using both methods, so this is unlikely to be a problem.

ZapTexture should have the more sensible abbreviations.

The module also contains some enhancements to the cursor keys so that when
they are  used in combination with the shift key they behave in a more
appropriate manner than when Zap is in text mode.  These routines have been
stolen from Martin Ebourne's C mode and are documented by him in his own
directory inside Zap.  Basically they make the shift-cursor combinations
pause more frequently so they step more intelligently through lines with few
spaces.  Martin has kindly given me his permission to use his code.

Those familiar with my other Zap modes may be wondering where the
equivalent to their BEAUTIFY command is.  As Texture Garden provides much of
the functionality of this command in its export text options, it has been
stripped out of the Zap mode to save space.  The Beautify menu option
remains, however, and those pining for the BEAUTIFY command will find that
setting a very large width, and then pressing SHIFT-CTRL-COPY (in the
default Zap keymap) can be used to produce a similar effect.


4.0 More details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The version number of ZapTexture should approximately track that of
Texture Garden, as it is updated as Texture Garden's texture generation
language expands.

For technical details on the module, users are referred to the documentation
to ZapObey which has a very similar internal structure.  This should be
available from my web site if you can't find it anywhere else.

Unlike another of my modes, ZapHoTMeaL, the command completion is not yet
context sensitive.  For more details of the command completion routines,
and details of how to configure the bracket matching delay, readers are
currently referred to the documentation of versions of ZapHoTMeaL greater
than version 0.51.
