Sort v2.00 (Darren Salt)
˜˜˜˜

This is a simple text sort program written in BASIC.

It sorts in straight ASCII order, either ascending or descending, and may be
case insensitive.

To use, select an area, then press Ctrl-Escape (or your equivalent) and type
the sort command, which has the syntax:


 FILTERSEL "ZF:Sort
  [-help]
  [-Ascending|-Descending]
  [-Case|-NoCase]
  [-skipSpaces|-NoskipSpaces]"


The options are as follows:

-help		     Displays the syntax message and exits

-ascending	-a   Sort into ascending ASCII order
-descending	-d   Sort into descending ASCII order

-nocase		-nc  Sort is not case sensitive
-case		-c   Sort is case sensitive

-noskipspaces  -ns  Leading spaces and tabs will not be ignored
-skipspaces	-s   Leading spaces and tabs will be ignored


The first option in each pair is the default option. Obviously you can't
specify (for example) both -case and -nocase.
